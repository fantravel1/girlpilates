## Important Note

Please get clearance from your healthcare provider before starting any postpartum exercise program. Este is typically around 6 weeks for vaginal birth and 8-12 weeks for cesarean birth. Every recovery is different.

## El Entrenamiento

## Signs to Stop

Stop exercising and consult your provider if you experience:
- Pain (different from muscle work)
- Bleeding that increases
- Feeling of heaviness or dragging in pelvis
- Leaking urine duaro exercises
- Any concerns at all

## Diastasis Recti Note

If you have diastasis recti (abdominal separation):
- Avoid crunches and planks initially
- Focus on transverse activation
- Consider seeing a pelvic floor physiotherapist
- Healing takes time - be patient with yourself

## Remember

- Your body did something amazing
- Recovery is not linear
- Rest is part of recovery
- Some days you'll feel stronger than others
- Listen to your body always
- There's no rush
