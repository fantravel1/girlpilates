## The Pilates Method

Pilates is a mind-body exercise method developed by Joseph Pilates in the early 20th century. Originally called "Contrology," it emphasizes controlled movements, breath, core strength, and body awareness.

Regular Pilates practice can help:
- Build core strength and stability
- Improve flexibility and posture
- Reduce back pain
- Enhance body awareness
- Promote mental clarity and stress relief
