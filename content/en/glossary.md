## A

**Abdominals**: The group of muscles forming the front of the torso, including the rectus abdominis, obliques, and transverse abdominis. Central to all Pilates work.

**Articulation**: The sequential movement of the spine, vertebra by vertebra. Essential for exercises like Roll Up and Pelvic Curl.

## B

**Box**: The imaginary rectangle formed by your shoulders and hips. Keeping the box square ensures proper alignment during exercises.

**Breathing (Lateral Thoracic)**: The Pilates breathing technique where you expand the ribcage sideways while keeping the abdominals engaged. Inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth.

## C

**C-Curve**: The curved shape of the spine when you round forward, like the letter C. Used in exercises like Roll Up and Spine Stretch.

**Cadillac**: Also called the Trapeze Table. A large Pilates apparatus with a raised mat, bars, springs, and straps for a wide variety of exercises.

**Center**: One of the six Pilates principles. Refers to the core or "powerhouse" from which all movement initiates.

**Chair (Wunda Chair)**: A compact Pilates apparatus with a pedal and springs, used for strengthening exercises in various positions.

**Classical Pilates**: The original method as taught by Joseph Pilates and his first-generation students ("Elders"). Follows a specific exercise order.

**Concentration**: One of the six Pilates principles. Full mental focus on each movement for maximum benefit.

**Contrology**: Joseph Pilates' original name for his method, emphasizing the mind's control over the body.

**Control**: One of the six Pilates principles. Every movement is deliberate and controlled, never using momentum.

**Core**: The muscles of the trunk including abdominals, back muscles, pelvic floor, and diaphragm. The foundation of all Pilates movement.

## D

**Diaphragm**: The dome-shaped muscle beneath the lungs that controls breathing. Works with the core muscles in Pilates.

## E

**Elders**: First-generation Pilates teachers who studied directly with Joseph Pilates. Includes Romana Kryzanowska, Ron Fletcher, and others.

## F

**Flow**: One of the six Pilates principles. Movements should be fluid and connected, creating a seamless workout.

**Flexion**: Bending movement that decreases the angle between body parts, like curling the spine forward.

## G

**Glutes (Gluteals)**: The muscles of the buttocks—gluteus maximus, medius, and minimus. Important for hip stability and leg work.

## H

**Hip Flexors**: Muscles at the front of the hip that lift the leg. Often tight from sitting; Pilates helps balance their strength.

**Hundred**: A foundational Pilates exercise involving pumping the arms while holding legs elevated. Named for 100 arm pumps (10 sets of 10).

## I

**Imprint**: A position where the lower back presses gently into the mat, flattening the natural curve. Used for certain abdominal exercises.

**Initiating from the Core**: Beginning each movement from the center/powerhouse rather than the limbs.

## L

**Ladder Barrel**: A Pilates apparatus combining a barrel with ladder rungs, used for stretching and strengthening exercises.

**Lateral Breathing**: See "Breathing (Lateral Thoracic)."

**Lengthening**: Creating space in the body, particularly the spine. Pilates emphasizes length over compression.

## M

**Magic Circle (Ring)**: A flexible ring with handles used to add resistance to exercises. Invented by Joseph Pilates.

**Mat Pilates**: Pilates exercises performed on a mat without large apparatus. The most accessible form of Pilates.

**Modification**: An adaptation of an exercise to make it easier or accommodate limitations.

## N

**Neutral Pelvis**: The natural position of the pelvis where the hip bones and pubic bone are level. The most common pelvic position in Pilates.

**Neutral Spine**: The natural curves of the spine—cervical, thoracic, and lumbar—maintained during exercise.

## O

**Obliques**: The side abdominal muscles (internal and external) responsible for rotation and lateral flexion of the trunk.

**Opposition**: Creating resistance or reach in opposite directions, like reaching the head and tailbone away from each other.

## P

**Pelvic Floor**: The hammock of muscles at the base of the pelvis. Part of the core system, engaged during Pilates breathing.

**Pilates Stance**: A V-position of the feet with heels together and toes slightly apart (about 2-3 inches). Used in standing work.

**Powerhouse**: The core muscles from the bottom of the ribs to the hip line, including abdominals, lower back, and glutes. The source of all movement.

**Precision**: One of the six Pilates principles. Attention to proper alignment and technique in every movement.

**Progression**: An advancement of an exercise to make it more challenging.

## R

**Reformer**: The most well-known Pilates apparatus, consisting of a sliding carriage, springs, straps, and footbar.

**Ribs-to-Hips Connection**: Engaging the abdominals to connect the lower ribs toward the hips, stabilizing the core.

## S

**Scoop**: Drawing the abdominals in and up, creating a hollowed shape. A cue for engaging the deep core muscles.

**Spine Corrector**: A Pilates apparatus shaped like a step barrel, used for stretching and strengthening the back.

**Stability**: The ability to maintain a position while moving other body parts. Core stability is fundamental to Pilates.

**Stacking**: Aligning the joints vertically, such as stacking the spine vertebra by vertebra when rolling up.

## T

**Tabletop**: A position where the legs are lifted with knees bent at 90 degrees and shins parallel to the floor.

**Teaser**: An advanced Pilates exercise balancing on the sit bones with legs extended at 45 degrees and arms reaching forward.

**Transverse Abdominis (TVA)**: The deepest abdominal muscle that wraps around the torso like a corset. Primary core stabilizer.

## W

**Wrap**: Engaging the outer hip muscles (rotators) to turn the legs slightly outward from the hip joint.

## Z

**Zipper and Hollow**: A cue for engaging the core by imagining zipping up from the pubic bone while hollowing the belly.
