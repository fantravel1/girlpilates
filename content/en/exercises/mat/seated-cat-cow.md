Seated Cat Cow brings the benefits of spinal flexion and extension to a seated position.

## Flow with Breath

This accessible variation works well for those who prefer seated exercises.

## Benefits

- **Spinal Mobility**: Moves spine through full range
- **Office Friendly**: Can do at desk
- **Breath Connection**: Links movement to breath
- **Warm Up**: Prepares spine for activity

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rushing** - Move slowly with breath
2. **Holding breath** - Coordinate breath with movement
3. **Minimal movement** - Use full range
4. **Slouching** - Start from tall seated position

## Tips for Success

- Synchronize breath with movement
- Feel each vertebra moving
- Keep movement smooth and flowing
