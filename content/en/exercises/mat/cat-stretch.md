Cat Stretch (also called Cat-Cow) is one of the most accessible spinal mobility exercises. It's perfect for warming up or winding down, and feels wonderful for tight backs.

## Spinal Wake-Up Call

This gentle exercise takes your spine through its full range of flexion and extension, lubricating the joints and warming up the muscles.

## Benefits

- **Spinal Mobility**: Full range of flexion and extension
- **Gentle Warm-Up**: Perfect way to start a practice
- **Breath Connection**: Links movement to breath beautifully
- **Stress Relief**: The rhythmic movement calms the nervous system

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Moving from shoulders only** - Move from your whole spine
2. **Rushing** - Slow, mindful movement
3. **Holding breath** - Breath guides the movement
4. **Collapsing in the middle** - Maintain core engagement

## Tips for Success

- Think of your spine as a string of pearls, moving one pearl at a time
- Let your head and tail lead the movement
- Close your eyes to feel the internal movement better
