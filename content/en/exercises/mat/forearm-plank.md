Forearm Plank removes wrist stress from the equation while providing an equally challenging core workout. It's often preferred for those with wrist issues.

## Wrist-Friendly Power

By placing the forearms on the ground, you eliminate wrist extension while creating a longer lever that can actually increase core demands.

## Benefits

- **Wrist Protection**: No wrist extension required
- **Core Challenge**: Longer lever arm increases difficulty
- **Shoulder Stability**: Different angle challenges shoulders
- **Accessible**: Works for those with wrist limitations

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Elbows too far forward** - Keep them under shoulders
2. **Hips sagging** - Maintain straight line
3. **Clasping hands too tight** - Stay relaxed
4. **Forgetting to breathe** - Steady breaths throughout

## Tips for Success

- Think of pushing the floor away with your forearms
- Keep your neck as an extension of your spine
- Engage glutes to help support the position
