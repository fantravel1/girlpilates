Twist and Reach combines rotation with a side bend to create a comprehensive stretch for the torso.

## Twist Then Reach

This exercise opens the entire side body while encouraging spinal rotation and deep breathing.

## Benefits

- **Spinal Mobility**: Rotation plus lateral flexion
- **Side Body Stretch**: Opens lats and obliques
- **Breathing**: Encourages deep rib expansion
- **Posture**: Counteracts sitting postures

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Collapsing** - Stay tall as you twist and reach
2. **Rushing** - Move slowly and breathe deeply
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe into the stretch
4. **Uneven sides** - Do equal repetitions each side

## Tips for Success

- Initiate the twist from your ribcage, not shoulders
- Reach long through fingertips as you side bend
- Breathe into the stretched side
