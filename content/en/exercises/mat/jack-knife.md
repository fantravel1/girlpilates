Jack Knife is an advanced exercise that combines Roll Over with a dynamic upward thrust of the legs. This challenging movement requires strength, control, and timing.

## Roll and Shoot

This exercise adds dynamic energy to the inversion, requiring precise timing and significant core strength.

## Benefits

- **Core Power**: Requires explosive core strength
- **Back Strength**: Supports inverted position
- **Coordination**: Times the upward thrust
- **Challenge**: Advanced full body exercise

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rolling onto neck** - Stay on shoulders
2. **Losing control** - Keep movement precise
3. **No pause at top** - Hold the shoulder stand briefly
4. **Rushing down** - Control the descent

## Tips for Success

- Press your arms firmly for the thrust
- Think of shooting your toes to the ceiling
- Use your core to control every part of the movement
