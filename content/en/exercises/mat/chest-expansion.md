Chest Expansion opens the front of the body while strengthening the upper back. The arm movement combined with head turns creates a comprehensive upper body exercise.

## Open Your Heart

This exercise counteracts the forward-rounded posture that develops from daily activities, opening the chest and strengthening postural muscles.

## Benefits

- **Chest Opening**: Stretches pectorals and front shoulders
- **Upper Back Strength**: Engages rhomboids and rear deltoids
- **Neck Mobility**: Head turns add cervical spine movement
- **Posture Improvement**: Strengthens muscles that support upright posture

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Leaning back** - Stay tall, only arms move back
2. **Shoulders lifting** - Keep shoulders down
3. **Rushing head turns** - Move slowly with control
4. **Holding breath** - Coordinate breath with movement

## Tips for Success

- Think of reaching your fingertips toward the wall behind you
- Keep your ribs knitted together, not flaring
- The movement comes from shoulder mobility, not spine extension
