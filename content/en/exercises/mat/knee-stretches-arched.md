Knee Stretches Arched reverses the spine position from the round version, challenging the back extensors while maintaining core control.

## Arch and Extend

This variation opens the chest and works the back muscles while challenging hip control and stability.

## Benefits

- **Back Strength**: Works spinal extensors
- **Chest Opening**: Counteracts rounded postures
- **Hip Flexor Work**: Active hip flexion throughout
- **Balance**: Core must stabilize arched position

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-arching** - Keep arch moderate and controlled
2. **Dropping head** - Keep gaze forward, neck long
3. **Collapsing shoulders** - Keep chest proud
4. **Losing core** - Maintain engagement even when arched

## Tips for Success

- Think of lengthening through your spine
- Keep shoulders down away from ears
- Breathe steadily throughout the movement
