Tree pose combines balance training with hip opening. It's a standing posture that builds focus, stability, and body awareness.

## Root and Rise

Like a tree with deep roots and branches reaching skyward, this pose grounds you through your standing leg while lifting through your spine.

## Benefits

- **Balance**: Challenges single-leg stability
- **Hip Opening**: External rotation opens the hip
- **Focus**: Requires mental concentration
- **Posture**: Encourages tall, upright alignment

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Foot on knee** - Place above or below, never on knee
2. **Hip hiking** - Keep hips level
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe steadily throughout
4. **Gripping toes** - Keep standing foot relaxed

## Tips for Success

- Press your foot and standing leg into each other
- Find a focal point for your gaze
- Engage your core for better stability
