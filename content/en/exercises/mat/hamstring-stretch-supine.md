Hamstring Stretch Supine is a comfortable way to stretch tight hamstrings while lying down.

## Reach and Hold

This supported position allows you to relax into the stretch.

## Benefits

- **Hamstring Flexibility**: Lengthens back of thigh
- **Lower Back Relief**: Releases tension
- **Supported Stretch**: Lying down is comfortable
- **Adjustable Intensity**: Easy to modify

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forcing straight leg** - Slight bend is fine
2. **Lifting head** - Keep head on mat
3. **Bottom leg lifting** - Keep it pressed down
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe throughout

## Tips for Success

- Relax your neck and shoulders
- Use a strap for more comfortable hold
- Breathe deeply to relax into stretch
