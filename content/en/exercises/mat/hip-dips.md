Hip Dips take the static side plank and add dynamic oblique work. The dipping motion creates an intense burn in your waistline muscles.

## Dynamic Oblique Burner

While regular side planks build isometric strength, Hip Dips add movement that targets your obliques through their full range.

## Benefits

- **Oblique Strength**: Primary movers are the side waist muscles
- **Core Stability**: Maintaining alignment requires full core engagement
- **Shoulder Stability**: Supporting arm builds shoulder strength
- **Waist Definition**: Targets the muscles that create waist shape

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rotating body** - Stay facing forward throughout
2. **Sinking into shoulder** - Press away from floor
3. **Dipping too low** - Control is more important than range
4. **Holding breath** - Exhale on the lift

## Tips for Success

- Keep your body in one plane - don't twist
- The movement is smooth like a pendulum
- Think of your obliques as the engine lifting your hips
