Leg Pull is an advanced plank exercise that combines leg lifting with a rocking motion, challenging full body strength and stability.

## Plank Power

This exercise tests your ability to maintain plank alignment while adding dynamic leg movement.

## Benefits

- **Core Stability**: Maintains plank during leg lift
- **Glute Strength**: Lifts leg against gravity
- **Calf Stretch**: Rocks into heel stretch
- **Full Body**: Integrates entire body

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Hips rotating** - Keep hips level
2. **Sagging through middle** - Maintain plank line
3. **Rushing** - Control the rock
4. **Lifting leg too high** - Quality over height

## Tips for Success

- Press firmly through your hands
- Think of your body as one solid unit
- Keep your neck long throughout
