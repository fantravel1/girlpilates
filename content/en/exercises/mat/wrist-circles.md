Wrist Circles maintain mobility in the wrists and hands, which is especially important for those who do repetitive hand work like typing.

## Care for Your Wrists

The wrists are often overlooked until problems develop. Regular mobility work keeps them healthy and functional.

## Benefits

- **Wrist Mobility**: Maintains range of motion
- **Circulation**: Increases blood flow to hands
- **Prevention**: Helps prevent repetitive strain
- **Joint Health**: Distributes synovial fluid

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Moving too fast** - Slow, controlled circles
2. **Tensing forearms** - Keep arms relaxed
3. **Skipping one direction** - Circle both ways equally
4. **Incomplete circles** - Use full range of motion

## Tips for Success

- Think of drawing perfect circles with your knuckles
- Keep the rest of your arm still
- Do these regularly throughout the day
