Donkey Kicks are a classic glute-building exercise that targets the gluteus maximus through hip extension. The movement mimics a donkey's kick - hence the fun name!

## Kick Your Way to Stronger Glutes

This exercise isolates the glutes in a way that's accessible to all fitness levels while still being challenging enough to build real strength.

## Benefits

- **Glute Strength**: Directly targets gluteus maximus
- **Hip Extension**: Improves range of motion in hip extension
- **Core Stability**: Requires core engagement to prevent arching
- **No Equipment Needed**: Effective using just bodyweight

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Arching lower back** - Keep spine neutral, don't overextend
2. **Straightening the leg** - Maintain 90-degree knee bend
3. **Swinging the leg** - Controlled movements only
4. **Forgetting the core** - Keep abs engaged throughout

## Tips for Success

- Think of pressing your heel toward the ceiling, not swinging your leg
- Keep your neck in line with your spine - don't look up
- Squeeze your glute at the top of each rep
