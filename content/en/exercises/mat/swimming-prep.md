Swimming Prep builds the coordination and back strength needed for the dynamic Swimming exercise. This slower version teaches the opposing limb pattern.

## Coordinate Opposites

This exercise teaches you to lift opposite arm and leg together, building the pattern for the faster version.

## Benefits

- **Back Strength**: Works spinal extensors
- **Coordination**: Develops opposite limb timing
- **Glute Activation**: Engages glutes to lift legs
- **Preparation**: Builds toward full Swimming

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Lifting too high** - Stay low and controlled
2. **Forgetting glutes** - Engage glutes before lifting legs
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe continuously
4. **Moving too fast** - Keep it slow to start

## Tips for Success

- Think of reaching long rather than lifting high
- Keep your neck neutral, gaze down
- Use your exhale to stabilize
