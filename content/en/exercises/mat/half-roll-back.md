Half Roll Back teaches spinal articulation and builds core strength. It's a foundational exercise that prepares you for more challenging rolling movements.

## Roll with Control

This exercise teaches you to move your spine sequentially - one vertebra at a time - while building the strength to control the movement.

## Benefits

- **Core Strength**: Builds abdominal strength
- **Spinal Articulation**: Teaches vertebra-by-vertebra movement
- **Control**: Develops movement control and awareness
- **Foundation**: Prepares for Roll Up and other exercises

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rolling too fast** - Slow, controlled movement
2. **Collapsing** - Maintain C-curve shape throughout
3. **Shoulders tensing** - Keep shoulders relaxed
4. **Holding breath** - Exhale as you roll back

## Tips for Success

- Think of your spine as a string of pearls, placing each one down
- Keep your gaze forward, not up at the ceiling
- The rolling back should feel like scooping your abs in
