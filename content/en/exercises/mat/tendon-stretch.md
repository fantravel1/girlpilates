Tendon Stretch challenges the hip flexors and core to lift the body while maintaining a rounded spine position.

## Scoop and Lift

This exercise develops the deep abdominal scoop while building hip flexor and arm strength.

## Benefits

- **Hip Flexor Strength**: Challenges hip flexion under load
- **Core Integration**: Requires deep abdominal work
- **Hamstring Stretch**: Lengthens back of legs
- **Arm Strength**: Supports body weight through arms

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Flat back** - Maintain C-curve throughout
2. **Shrugging shoulders** - Press down, keep shoulders away from ears
3. **Lifting too high** - Focus on scoop, not height
4. **Holding breath** - Exhale to lift

## Tips for Success

- Focus on scooping your belly before lifting
- Press down through your hands to lift up
- Think of your spine curving into a C-shape
