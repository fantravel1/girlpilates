The Shoulder Bridge is a foundational exercise that strengthens the posterior chain while teaching spinal articulation. It's the perfect antidote to sitting.

## Open the Front, Strengthen the Back

After hours of sitting with flexed hips, Shoulder Bridge opens the front of your body while building strength in your glutes and hamstrings.

## Benefits

- **Glute Activation**: Strengthens the muscles you sit on all day
- **Hip Flexor Stretch**: Opens the front of the hips
- **Spinal Articulation**: Rolling up and down mobilizes the spine
- **Core Stability**: Maintaining the bridge requires core engagement

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Arching lower back** - Keep ribs connected to hips
2. **Lifting too high** - Maintain a straight line, no banana back
3. **Pushing through neck** - Weight stays in shoulders, not neck
4. **Rushing the roll** - Take time to feel each vertebra

## Tips for Success

- Press evenly through both feet
- Think of knitting your ribs toward your hips
- The roll down is just as important as the roll up
