Tricep Press isolates the back of the arms while lying down, building arm strength and tone.

## Tone the Back of Arms

This exercise specifically targets the triceps through controlled extension and flexion of the elbow.

## Benefits

- **Tricep Strength**: Isolates back of arms
- **Arm Definition**: Tones upper arms
- **Joint Health**: Strengthens elbow stability
- **Controlled Movement**: Builds precision

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Moving upper arms** - Keep still from shoulder to elbow
2. **Flaring elbows** - Point elbows toward ceiling
3. **Arching back** - Keep spine neutral
4. **Rushing** - Move with control

## Tips for Success

- Imagine your upper arms are glued in place
- Only your forearms should move
- Squeeze triceps at the top of each extension
