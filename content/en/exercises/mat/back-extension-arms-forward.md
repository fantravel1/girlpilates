Back Extension Arms Forward strengthens the entire back line while challenging shoulder stability.

## Reach and Lift

This exercise builds back strength while teaching proper extension mechanics.

## Benefits

- **Back Strength**: Works entire posterior chain
- **Posture**: Counteracts forward posture
- **Shoulder Work**: Arms forward adds challenge
- **Core Integration**: Requires core support

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Looking up** - Keep gaze down at mat
2. **Over-arching** - Lift with length, not height
3. **Forgetting glutes** - Engage before lifting
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe throughout

## Tips for Success

- Think of reaching long rather than lifting high
- Engage your glutes before you lift
- Keep your neck in line with your spine
