faq:
  - q: "My neck hurts when I do this. What's wrong?"
    a: "You're likely pulling with your hands. Think of lifting your chest, not your head. Try the hand support modification."
  - q: "I don't feel my abs working. Why?"
    a: "Focus on drawing your navel toward your spine as you lift. The work should come from your deep abs."
  - q: "How high should I lift?"
    a: "Just until your shoulder blades clear the mat. Higher isn't better - quality of engagement matters more."

Chest Lift is the foundation for almost every ab exercise in Pilates. Master this, and you'll have the proper engagement for the Hundred, Series of Five, and beyond.

## The Building Block

Before you can do advanced ab work, you need to know how to lift properly. Chest Lift teaches the correct mechanics that protect your neck and engage your deep abs.

## Benefits

- **Core Engagement**: Teaches proper ab activation
- **Neck Safety**: Correct form protects the neck
- **Foundation Building**: Prepares you for advanced exercises
- **Body Awareness**: Feel where the work should come from

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Pulling on neck** - Hands support only, abs do the work
2. **Leading with chin** - Keep chin slightly tucked
3. **Using momentum** - Control the lift and lower
4. **Holding breath** - Exhale to lift, inhale to lower

## Tips for Success

- Think of curling your chest toward your hips
- Your hands are a hammock for your head, not a lever
- Keep your lower back gently pressed into the mat
