Seated Side Stretch opens the entire side body, stretching muscles that are often neglected.

## Reach and Stretch

This calming stretch targets the intercostal muscles between the ribs, improving breathing capacity.

## Benefits

- **Side Body Opening**: Stretches obliques and lats
- **Breathing**: Opens ribs for better breathing
- **Posture**: Counteracts side compression
- **Relaxation**: Calming stretch

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Collapsing chest** - Keep chest open
2. **Twisting** - Stay in lateral plane, don't rotate
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe into the stretched side
4. **Rushing** - Hold long enough to feel the stretch

## Tips for Success

- Reach up and over, not just to the side
- Keep both sit bones grounded
- Breathe deeply into your ribcage
