faq:
  - q: "Should my lower back lift when I extend?"
    a: "No - if it does, raise your legs higher. Your back should stay imprinted on the mat."
  - q: "How big should my arm circle be?"
    a: "Arms sweep out to the sides and around, like you're making snow angels. Keep them in your peripheral vision."
  - q: "I feel this in my hip flexors, not abs. Is that wrong?"
    a: "Raise your legs higher and focus on scooping your abs deeper. The hip flexors will work, but abs should dominate."

The Double Leg Stretch is the second exercise in the "Series of Five." It builds on the Single Leg Stretch by challenging you to maintain your core engagement while all four limbs extend away from center.

## The Ultimate Core Challenge

As your arms and legs reach away, your center must work harder to keep you stable. This is Pilates at its finest - controlled movement from a strong center.

## Benefits

- **Deep Core Activation**: Maximum challenge for your powerhouse
- **Coordination**: Synchronizing breath, arms, and legs
- **Spinal Stability**: Learning to move limbs without moving spine
- **Increased Range**: Full body stretch with control

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Losing the curl** - Keep head and shoulders lifted throughout
2. **Lower back arching** - Scoop abs deeper, raise legs higher if needed
3. **Rushing** - This is about control, not speed
4. **Breath holding** - Inhale to extend, exhale to return

## Tips for Success

- Imagine your limbs are connected to your center by springs
- The further you reach, the more your abs must engage
- Think "long" through your fingertips and toes
