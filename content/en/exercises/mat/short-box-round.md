Short Box Round develops core control through a rolling movement with a curved spine. This exercise builds strength for the classical reformer Short Box series.

## Roll With Control

This exercise teaches you to maintain spinal flexion while moving through space, building the eccentric and concentric control needed for many Pilates exercises.

## Benefits

- **Core Strength**: Eccentric and concentric abdominal work
- **Spinal Flexion Control**: Maintains curve while moving
- **Hip Flexor Engagement**: Works to anchor lower body
- **Foundation**: Prepares for Short Box series

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Flattening spine** - Keep C-curve throughout
2. **Going too far** - Stay within your control range
3. **Using momentum** - Move slowly with control
4. **Holding breath** - Exhale as you roll back

## Tips for Success

- Imagine rolling through your spine one vertebra at a time
- Keep your belly scooped deeply throughout
- Use your exhale to initiate the movement
