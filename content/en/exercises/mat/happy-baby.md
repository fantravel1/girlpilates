Happy Baby is a playful hip opener that stretches the inner thighs and releases lower back tension.

## Open Like a Baby

This gentle stretch mimics the natural position of a happy baby, opening the hips and inner thighs.

## Benefits

- **Hip Opening**: Deep stretch for hips
- **Inner Thigh Stretch**: Opens adductors
- **Lower Back Release**: Massages lower spine
- **Relaxation**: Calming, restorative position

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Tensing up** - Stay relaxed throughout
2. **Forcing feet down** - Let gravity help
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe deeply
4. **Straining neck** - Keep head on mat

## Tips for Success

- Let your tailbone be heavy on the mat
- Keep feet flexed to protect knees
- Rock side to side if it feels good
