Scissors is part of the classical mat series that follows the Series of Five. It challenges your core while giving your hamstrings a dynamic stretch.

## The Split in Motion

Think of this as a moving stretch. Each scissor motion lengthens the back of one leg while strengthening the hip flexor of the other.

## Benefits

- **Hamstring Flexibility**: Dynamic stretching increases range
- **Hip Flexor Strength**: Lowering leg challenges the hip flexors
- **Core Endurance**: Maintaining curl builds stamina
- **Coordination**: Switching legs smoothly requires focus

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Lower back lifting** - Keep it imprinted on the mat
2. **Pulling too aggressively** - Gentle pulses, not yanks
3. **Losing the curl** - Keep head and shoulders lifted
4. **Rushing the switch** - Control the transition

## Tips for Success

- Think of your legs as the blades of scissors
- Keep energy reaching through both legs
- The pulse should deepen the stretch, not bounce it
