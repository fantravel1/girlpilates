Snow Angels is a gentle mobility exercise that opens the chest and shoulders. The movement mimics making snow angels, hence the playful name.

## Open Up

This exercise counteracts the forward-hunched posture many of us develop, opening the front of the body while keeping the back supported.

## Benefits

- **Chest Opening**: Stretches pectorals and front shoulders
- **Shoulder Mobility**: Improves range of motion
- **Posture Correction**: Counteracts rounded shoulders
- **Relaxation**: Gentle, soothing movement

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Back arching** - Keep lower back connected to mat
2. **Forcing range** - Work within your comfortable range
3. **Moving too fast** - Slow, controlled movements
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe naturally

## Tips for Success

- Let gravity and your breath help open your chest
- Keep your ribs down as your arms move overhead
- This should feel like a gentle stretch, never painful
