Frog Press is a targeted exercise that strengthens the inner thighs while challenging core stability.

## Press and Squeeze

This dynamic movement combines the frog position with leg extension for inner thigh work.

## Benefits

- **Inner Thigh Strength**: Targets adductor muscles
- **Core Stability**: Maintains neutral spine during movement
- **Hip Mobility**: Works from externally rotated position
- **Coordination**: Combines multiple muscle groups

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Arching back** - Keep spine neutral throughout
2. **Rushing** - Move with control
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe smoothly
4. **Losing frog shape** - Return fully to start position

## Tips for Success

- Imagine squeezing a ball between your thighs as you extend
- Keep your core engaged throughout
- Focus on the inner thigh connection
