Toe Touch is a classic ab exercise that combines a crunch with a reach toward the toes.

## Reach for Your Toes

This exercise challenges the abdominals through the reaching motion while gently stretching the hamstrings.

## Benefits

- **Ab Strength**: Works rectus abdominis
- **Hamstring Stretch**: Reaching stretches back of legs
- **Upper Ab Focus**: Crunching targets upper abs
- **Coordination**: Combines lift with reach

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using momentum** - Move with control
2. **Straining neck** - Lead with chest, not chin
3. **Forcing reach** - Go as far as comfortable
4. **Flat lower back** - Slight imprint is okay

## Tips for Success

- Exhale as you crunch up and reach
- Think of curling your ribs toward your hips
- Keep the movement controlled, not bouncy
