Dead Bug is one of the best exercises for learning core stability. The supine position gives you feedback from the floor - if your back arches, you've gone too far.

## The Ultimate Core Teacher

This exercise teaches you the fundamental skill of stabilizing your spine while your limbs move - essential for everything from walking to advanced Pilates.

## Benefits

- **Core Stability**: Learn to stabilize while limbs move
- **Back Protection**: Develops the stabilizers that protect your spine
- **Coordination**: Opposite limb pattern challenges motor control
- **Feedback**: Floor tells you if you're doing it right

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Back arching** - Keep lower back pressed into mat
2. **Rushing** - Slow, controlled movement
3. **Range too big** - Only go as far as you can control
4. **Forgetting to breathe** - Exhale as limbs lower

## Tips for Success

- Press your lower back into the mat like you're making an imprint
- Only lower as far as your back stays flat
- Think of your core as the anchor for all movement
