Shoulder Shrugs are a simple but effective way to release tension in the upper trapezius muscles. The contract-release pattern helps reset chronic muscle tightness.

## Release and Reset

By deliberately contracting the muscles that hold tension, then fully releasing, you can achieve a deeper state of relaxation than passive stretching alone.

## Benefits

- **Tension Release**: Releases chronic upper trap tightness
- **Awareness**: Teaches the difference between tension and relaxation
- **Quick Relief**: Can be done anywhere, anytime
- **Stress Reduction**: Physical release supports mental relaxation

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Incomplete release** - Let shoulders drop fully
2. **Rushing** - Hold at top, release slowly
3. **Holding breath** - Coordinate breath with movement
4. **Tensing neck** - Keep neck long

## Tips for Success

- Really exaggerate the lift to feel the full release
- Focus on the exhale and letting go completely
- Do several times throughout the day for best results
