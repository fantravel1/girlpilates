Seal Prep develops the balance and rolling skills for the playful Seal exercise. This fun movement builds core control while teaching smooth spinal articulation.

## Roll Like a Ball

This exercise takes Rolling Like a Ball to a new position, with arms threaded through legs for a different balance challenge.

## Benefits

- **Core Control**: Requires deep abdominal engagement
- **Spinal Massage**: Rolls through each vertebra
- **Balance**: Challenges seated balance position

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Losing ball shape** - Keep compact throughout
2. **Using momentum** - Roll with control
3. **Throwing head** - Keep chin tucked
4. **Tight grip** - Hold ankles gently

## Tips for Success

- Think of your body as one solid ball
- Use your exhale to initiate the roll
