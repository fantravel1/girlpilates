Jackknife is a dramatic exercise that combines a roll-up with a shoulder stand and a controlled hinge. It's a test of strength, control, and spinal articulation.

## Power and Precision

This exercise requires explosive power to shoot the legs up, and precise control to hinge and lower with grace.

## Benefits

- **Core Power**: The upward thrust requires strong abs
- **Spinal Articulation**: Rolling up and down vertebra by vertebra
- **Control**: The hinge is a study in controlled movement
- **Inversion Benefits**: Blood flow reversal refreshes the body

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Weight on neck** - Keep weight on shoulders and arms
2. **Using momentum only** - Control both directions
3. **Collapsing on descent** - Lower with control
4. **Forgetting to breathe** - Exhale on the effort

## Tips for Success

- Press firmly into your arms throughout
- The "jackknife" happens at your hips, not your waist
- If you can't do it with control, you need more preparation
