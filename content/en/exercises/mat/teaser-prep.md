Teaser Prep builds the foundational strength needed for the challenging Teaser exercise. This progression teaches proper engagement before adding the full movement.

## Build Your V

This preparatory exercise develops the core strength and control needed to eventually perform the full Teaser with grace and control.

## Benefits

- **Core Strength**: Intense abdominal engagement
- **Hip Flexor Control**: Coordinates leg and torso movement
- **Balance**: Develops balance point awareness
- **Preparation**: Builds toward full Teaser

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using momentum** - Move with control, not speed
2. **Arching lower back** - Keep lower back supported
3. **Holding breath** - Exhale on the effort
4. **Straining neck** - Keep neck long

## Tips for Success

- Think of lifting from your center
- Reach your legs away as you lift your torso
- Find the balance point on your sit bones
