Hip Opener Seated is a simple but effective stretch for the outer hips and piriformis muscle.

## Open Your Hips

This figure-4 position targets the deep hip rotators that often become tight from sitting.

## Benefits

- **Hip Flexibility**: Opens outer hips
- **Piriformis Relief**: Stretches deep rotator
- **Lower Back Relief**: Tight hips affect back
- **Daily Maintenance**: Easy to do anywhere

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rounding back** - Keep spine tall
2. **Forcing depth** - Go only as far as comfortable
3. **Knee pressure** - Feel stretch in hip, not knee
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe deeply into stretch

## Tips for Success

- Flex the crossed foot to protect the knee
- Keep your spine long as you lean forward
- Breathe into the stretch area
