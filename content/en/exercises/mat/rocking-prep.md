Rocking Prep builds the back strength and flexibility needed for the dynamic Rocking exercise. This static hold teaches proper alignment before adding the rocking motion.

## Build Your Bow

This exercise creates a bow shape with your body, opening the front while strengthening the back.

## Benefits

- **Back Strength**: Strengthens spinal extensors
- **Hip Flexor Stretch**: Opens front of hips and thighs
- **Shoulder Mobility**: Requires shoulder flexibility
- **Full Body Opening**: Creates opening through entire front body

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Compressing lower back** - Engage glutes to protect spine
2. **Knees too wide** - Keep hip-width apart
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe through the hold
4. **Forcing reach** - Use a strap if needed

## Tips for Success

- Squeeze your glutes before you lift
- Think of reaching your chest forward and up
- Keep your neck long, gaze slightly down
