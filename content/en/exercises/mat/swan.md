faq:
  - q: "My lower back hurts. Am I doing it wrong?"
    a: "You're likely crunching into your lower back. Lengthen through the crown of your head and distribute the extension throughout your whole spine."
  - q: "How high should I lift?"
    a: "Only as high as you can while keeping pubic bone on mat and without pain. Height comes with practice."
  - q: "Should I squeeze my glutes hard?"
    a: "Light engagement only - about 20%. Over-squeezing compresses the lower back."

The Swan is Pilates' answer to back strengthening. In a world where we're constantly hunched forward, Swan opens the front body while building strength in the back.

## Counter the Slouch

Modern life has us curved forward over phones and computers. Swan reverses this pattern, restoring balance to the spine.

## Benefits

- **Back Strength**: Builds the erector spinae muscles
- **Chest Opening**: Stretches the pectorals and shoulders
- **Improved Posture**: Counteracts forward head position
- **Spinal Extension**: Increases extension mobility

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Jamming into lower back** - Think length, not height
2. **Lifting shoulders to ears** - Keep them down and back
3. **Clenching the glutes** - Light engagement only
4. **Looking up too high** - Keep gaze forward, neck long

## Tips for Success

- Imagine a headlight on your chest shining forward
- Lead with the crown of your head reaching forward and up
- Think about lengthening your spine rather than bending it
