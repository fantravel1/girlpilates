Grasshopper is a playful prone exercise that strengthens the posterior chain while adding a rhythmic beating component.

## Beat Like a Grasshopper

This exercise combines glute activation with rhythmic leg beats, creating dynamic work for the back body.

## Benefits

- **Glute Activation**: Strong posterior chain work
- **Inner Thigh Work**: Beating engages adductors
- **Back Strengthening**: Supports spinal extensors
- **Coordination**: Adds rhythmic element

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-arching back** - Engage core to protect spine
2. **Lifting too high** - Quality over height
3. **Forgetting to breathe** - Breathe with the rhythm
4. **Tensing shoulders** - Keep upper body relaxed

## Tips for Success

- Squeeze glutes before lifting thighs
- Keep beats controlled and even
- Think of lengthening through your spine
