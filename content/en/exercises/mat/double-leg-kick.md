faq:
  - q: "Where should I clasp my hands?"
    a: "As high up your back as comfortable - ideally between shoulder blades. Lower is fine if shoulders are tight."
  - q: "My shoulders won't let me clasp behind my back."
    a: "Hold a strap or towel between hands if you can't clasp. Work on shoulder flexibility separately."
  - q: "Why do I turn my head?"
    a: "Alternating sides prevents neck strain and ensures even work on both sides."

Double Leg Kick is a wonderful combination exercise that stretches the shoulders and chest while strengthening the entire back body. The triple kick gives it rhythm and energy.

## Three Parts, One Flow

This exercise has three distinct phases - kicks, extension, return - but they should flow seamlessly into each other.

## Benefits

- **Shoulder Stretch**: Hands clasped behind opens the chest
- **Back Strength**: Extension phase builds back muscles
- **Glute Activation**: Kicking both legs engages glutes
- **Coordination**: Multi-phase movement challenges brain and body

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rushing the kicks** - Three distinct kicks, not one
2. **Straining neck** - Keep neck long, turn head gently
3. **Over-arching in extension** - Length over height
4. **Forgetting arms** - They extend back in the lift phase

## Tips for Success

- Think of the kicks as pumping energy into the extension
- In the lift, reach arms toward feet, chest toward wall
- Each phase has its own breath: kick-kick-kick (exhale), lift (inhale)
