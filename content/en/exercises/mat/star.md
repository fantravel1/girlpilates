Star is one of the most visually impressive exercises in Pilates. It demands strength, balance, and courage to hold this expansive position.

## Shine Bright

This exercise creates the shape of a star, with limbs extending in all directions while you balance on one hand and foot.

## Benefits

- **Full Body Challenge**: Every muscle group engages
- **Balance Mastery**: Extreme balance demands
- **Hip Strength**: Top leg works against gravity
- **Core Power**: Obliques work intensely to stabilize

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Collapsing into shoulder** - Press away from floor
2. **Holding breath** - Keep breathing throughout
3. **Forcing leg height** - Balance over height
4. **Losing alignment** - Keep body in one plane

## Tips for Success

- Master regular side plank before attempting this
- Build up - first arm, then add leg
- Focus on a spot ahead to help with balance
