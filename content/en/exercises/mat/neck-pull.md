faq:
  - q: "Why is it called Neck Pull if I shouldn't pull my neck?"
    a: "The name refers to the hand position, not the action. Never pull on your neck - support your head's weight and let your abs do the work."
  - q: "My feet keep lifting when I roll up. Help!"
    a: "This is common. Try the weighted feet modification or bend your knees. Core strength will develop over time."
  - q: "What's the difference between Neck Pull and Roll Up?"
    a: "The hand position and the addition of the tall spine position. Neck Pull is significantly more challenging."

Neck Pull is Roll Up's challenging older sibling. With hands behind the head, there's no assistance from arm momentum - your abs must do all the work.

## Roll Up, Level Expert

The hand position eliminates any help from reaching arms, making this one of the most challenging ab exercises in the Pilates repertoire.

## Benefits

- **Ultimate Ab Challenge**: No arm assistance means pure core work
- **Spinal Articulation**: Moving through every vertebra
- **Hamstring Stretch**: Forward fold stretches back of legs
- **Posture**: The tall spine position reinforces good posture

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Pulling on neck** - Support head, don't yank
2. **Using momentum** - Control every inch of movement
3. **Skipping the tall spine** - Include this important position
4. **Flat back rounding** - Hinge back flat before rolling down

## Tips for Success

- Think of your hands as a shelf for your head
- The challenge is controlling the descent - don't just drop down
- If you can't do it without feet lifting, you're not ready yet
