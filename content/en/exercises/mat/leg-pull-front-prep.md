Leg Pull Front Prep builds the strength and stability needed for the full Leg Pull Front exercise. This variation teaches you to maintain plank alignment while adding the challenge of hip extension.

## Plank Plus Hip Extension

This preparatory exercise combines the stability demands of a plank with hip extension, building strength for more advanced variations.

## Benefits

- **Plank Strength**: Builds core and shoulder stability
- **Hip Extension**: Strengthens glutes and hamstrings
- **Anti-Rotation**: Trains core to resist rotation
- **Preparation**: Builds toward full exercise

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Hips lifting** - Keep body in one straight line
2. **Hips rotating** - Keep pelvis level
3. **Holding breath** - Maintain steady breathing
4. **Lifting leg too high** - Quality over height

## Tips for Success

- Think of your body as one solid plank
- Squeeze your glutes as you lift
- Keep your neck long, gaze slightly forward
