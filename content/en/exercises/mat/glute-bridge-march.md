Glute Bridge March adds a stability challenge to the regular bridge by removing one foot from the ground at a time. It's excellent for building single-leg strength.

## March to Stronger Glutes

The marching motion challenges your glutes to work unilaterally while your core fights to keep your hips level.

## Benefits

- **Unilateral Glute Work**: Each side works independently
- **Hip Stability**: Keeping hips level challenges stabilizers
- **Core Engagement**: Abs work to prevent rotation
- **Functional Strength**: Mimics walking and running patterns

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Hips dropping** - Keep them level throughout
2. **Rocking side to side** - Control the movement
3. **Rushing** - Slow, controlled marches
4. **Forgetting to breathe** - Exhale on the lift

## Tips for Success

- Think of your hips as a table - keep it level
- Press through the standing foot firmly
- The smaller the movement, the easier to control
