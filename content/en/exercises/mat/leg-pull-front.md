Leg Pull Front transforms the basic plank into a dynamic Pilates exercise. The leg lifts challenge your core to maintain stability while extremities move.

## Plank Plus

This is a plank with homework. Adding the leg lift and rocking motion takes this foundational position to an advanced level.

## Benefits

- **Core Stability**: Maintaining plank with leg lift is intensely challenging
- **Shoulder Strength**: Arms support body weight throughout
- **Glute Activation**: Lifting leg engages the glutes
- **Full Body Integration**: Every muscle works together

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Hips piking up** - Keep body in one straight line
2. **Hips dropping** - Engage abs to support the spine
3. **Rotating when leg lifts** - Keep hips square to floor
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe throughout

## Tips for Success

- Think of your body as a stiff board
- Keep your gaze slightly ahead of your hands
- The lift is small - stability is more important than height
