Wall Roll Down teaches spinal articulation in a supported standing position. The wall provides feedback about your spine position and helps you feel each vertebra moving.

## Learn with Support

The wall is like a teacher, showing you where your spine is in space and helping you understand the rolling motion.

## Benefits

- **Spinal Articulation**: Learn to move spine sequentially
- **Awareness**: Wall provides feedback about position
- **Hamstring Stretch**: Gentle stretch for back of legs
- **Postural Reset**: Great for releasing tension

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Moving too fast** - Roll slowly, one vertebra at a time
2. **Locking knees** - Keep a soft bend
3. **Holding breath** - Exhale as you roll down
4. **Tensing shoulders** - Let arms hang heavy

## Tips for Success

- Imagine your spine is peeling off the wall like tape
- Keep your weight slightly forward in your feet
- Use this exercise to check in with your spine daily
