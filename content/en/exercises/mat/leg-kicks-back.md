Leg Kicks Back targets the glutes through hip extension while stretching the hip flexors. It's the counterpart to Leg Kicks Front.

## Glute-Focused Kicks

The backward kick engages the glutes and stretches the front of the hip, helping to counteract tight hip flexors from sitting.

## Benefits

- **Glute Strength**: Back kick activates the glutes
- **Hip Flexor Stretch**: Extension stretches the front of hip
- **Core Stability**: Torso must stay stable
- **Posture Support**: Strengthens posterior chain

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Back arching** - Keep spine neutral
2. **Torso rotating** - Keep hips stacked
3. **Kicking too far** - Only as far as spine stays stable
4. **Losing alignment** - Maintain straight body line

## Tips for Success

- Squeeze your glute to initiate the kick
- Think of lengthening your leg backward, not just lifting
- Keep your core engaged throughout
