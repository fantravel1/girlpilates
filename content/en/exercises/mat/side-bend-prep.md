Side Bend Prep develops the lateral strength needed for the classical Side Bend exercise. This modified version builds strength while teaching proper alignment.

## Build Lateral Strength

This preparatory exercise targets the obliques and shoulder stabilizers, building strength for more advanced lateral exercises.

## Benefits

- **Oblique Strength**: Targets side body muscles
- **Shoulder Stability**: Builds supporting shoulder strength
- **Hip Strength**: Works outer hip muscles
- **Preparation**: Builds toward classical Side Bend

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Shoulder collapsing** - Keep shoulder stable over hand
2. **Hips sagging** - Lift hips in line with body
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe through the movement
4. **Rushing** - Move with control

## Tips for Success

- Push firmly through your supporting hand
- Create one long line from head to knees
- Reach your top arm to create length
