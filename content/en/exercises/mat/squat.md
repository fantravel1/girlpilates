The Squat is a fundamental movement pattern that strengthens the entire lower body and core.

## Sit Back Strong

This exercise mimics the motion of sitting and standing, building functional strength for daily life.

## Benefits

- **Leg Strength**: Works quads, hamstrings, and glutes
- **Functional**: Mimics daily sitting and standing
- **Core Engagement**: Requires core stability
- **Bone Health**: Weight-bearing for bone density

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Knees caving in** - Keep knees tracking over toes
2. **Rounding back** - Keep chest lifted
3. **Rising onto toes** - Keep weight in heels
4. **Going too fast** - Move with control

## Tips for Success

- Think of sitting back into an invisible chair
- Keep your core engaged throughout
- Push through your heels to stand
