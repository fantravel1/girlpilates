Clam Shell is a deceptively challenging exercise that targets the often-neglected glute medius. This small but mighty muscle is essential for hip stability and proper gait.

## Small Muscle, Big Impact

The glute medius sits on the outside of your hip. It's crucial for everything from walking to standing on one leg. Clam Shells target it precisely.

## Benefits

- **Glute Medius Strength**: Targets this key stabilizer muscle
- **Hip Stability**: Builds the muscles that prevent hip drop
- **Injury Prevention**: Strong glute med prevents many lower body issues
- **Pelvic Control**: Teaches hip dissociation

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rolling hips back** - Keep them perfectly stacked
2. **Lifting too high** - Range is small for most people
3. **Using momentum** - Slow, controlled lifts
4. **Rushing** - Quality over quantity

## Tips for Success

- Focus on the burn in the outside of your hip
- Keep feet glued together throughout
- The movement is smaller than you think - don't force it
