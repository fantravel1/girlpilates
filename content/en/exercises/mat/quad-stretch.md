Quad Stretch targets the quadriceps muscles on the front of the thigh. These muscles often become tight from sitting and activities like cycling and running.

## Release the Front of Your Thigh

The quadriceps are powerful muscles that can become shortened from extended sitting. Regular stretching helps maintain their flexibility.

## Benefits

- **Quad Flexibility**: Lengthens the quadriceps muscles
- **Hip Flexor Stretch**: Also stretches the hip flexors
- **Knee Health**: Balanced quad length supports knee health
- **Posture Support**: Flexible quads help maintain neutral pelvis

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Arching back** - Keep pelvis tucked slightly
2. **Pulling too hard** - Gentle, sustained pressure
3. **Knees apart** - Keep knees together or close
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe deeply throughout

## Tips for Success

- Tuck your pelvis slightly to intensify the stretch
- Keep your body in a straight line
- Relax into the stretch with each exhale
