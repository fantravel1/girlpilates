Seal is the joyful finale to the traditional Pilates mat sequence. It massages your spine, makes you laugh, and reminds you that exercise can be fun.

## End on a High Note

After all the challenging work in your Pilates practice, Seal gives you permission to be playful. The clapping and rolling release tension and bring a smile.

## Benefits

- **Balance Challenge**: Pausing to clap requires control
- **Joy**: Seriously - this exercise makes people happy!

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

3. **Taking it too seriously** - Let yourself be playful!
4. **Uncontrolled rolling** - Use your abs to control the movement

## Tips for Success

- The claps should be rhythmic and fun - "clap, clap, clap!"
- Keep a consistent ball shape throughout
- Let yourself smile - it's supposed to be fun!
