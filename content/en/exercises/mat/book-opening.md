Book Opening is a gentle yet powerful exercise for opening the chest and improving thoracic rotation. It's like giving your upper back a mini-vacation from hunched posture.

## Open Your Pages

Like a book opening its pages, this exercise creates space in your chest and rotation through your upper back.

## Benefits

- **Chest Opening**: Stretches the pectorals and front of shoulder
- **Thoracic Rotation**: Improves mid-back mobility
- **Posture Relief**: Counteracts hunched positions
- **Relaxation**: The gentle movement calms the nervous system

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Knees separating** - Keep them glued together
2. **Forcing rotation** - Let it be gentle and gradual
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe deeply into the stretch
4. **Rushing** - Take time to feel each opening

## Tips for Success

- Let gravity help your arm fall toward the floor
- Use each exhale to deepen the opening
- Keep your bottom arm stable as your top arm moves
