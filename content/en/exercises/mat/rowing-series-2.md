Rowing Series 2 adds a forward fold to the rowing pattern, creating a comprehensive stretch and strengthen combination.

## Row and Fold

This exercise combines upper back work with a deep hamstring and shoulder stretch.

## Benefits

- **Shoulder Opening**: Arms reach behind stretches chest
- **Hamstring Stretch**: Forward fold lengthens legs
- **Spinal Articulation**: Rolling up mobilizes spine
- **Upper Back Work**: Rowing strengthens back

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forcing the fold** - Go only as far as comfortable
2. **Losing tall spine** - Roll through spine, don't collapse
3. **Arms dropping** - Keep reaching arms back
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe throughout

## Tips for Success

- Use your core to initiate the forward fold
- Keep reaching arms back as you fold forward
- Roll up through the spine one vertebra at a time
