Fire Hydrant is a highly effective exercise for targeting the gluteus medius and hip abductors. The name comes from the movement pattern that resembles a dog at a fire hydrant!

## Open Your Hips

This exercise works the hip in abduction - moving away from the midline of the body - which strengthens muscles often neglected in traditional exercises.

## Benefits

- **Outer Glute Strength**: Targets gluteus medius and minimus
- **Hip Mobility**: Improves hip range of motion
- **Core Stability**: Requires core engagement to prevent rotation
- **Functional Movement**: Builds lateral hip strength for daily activities

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Hiking the hip** - Keep both hips level
2. **Arching the back** - Maintain neutral spine
3. **Shifting weight** - Keep weight evenly distributed
4. **Rushing** - Slow, controlled movements

## Tips for Success

- Imagine your hips are headlights that should stay pointed at the floor
- Focus on initiating the movement from your glute, not your knee
- Keep your supporting knee directly under your hip
