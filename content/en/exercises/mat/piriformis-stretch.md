Piriformis Stretch targets the piriformis muscle, a deep hip rotator that can become tight from sitting. When tight, it can compress the sciatic nerve.

## Relief for Deep Hip Tightness

The piriformis is a small but important muscle. When it's tight, it can cause significant discomfort. This stretch provides targeted relief.

## Benefits

- **Piriformis Release**: Directly stretches the piriformis
- **Sciatic Relief**: Can help relieve sciatic nerve compression
- **Hip Opening**: Opens the deep hip rotators
- **Low Back Relief**: Releasing hips often helps the back

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Foot not flexed** - Always flex ankle to protect knee
2. **Pulling too hard** - Gentle, sustained stretch is best
3. **Lifting head** - Keep head relaxed on mat
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe deeply to help release

## Tips for Success

- Keep the crossed foot actively flexed
- Let gravity and breath do the work
- Hold long enough for the muscle to release
