Glute Kickback isolates and strengthens the gluteus maximus through a controlled lifting motion.

## Kick Back Strong

This targeted exercise focuses all the work on the glutes for effective shaping and strengthening.

## Benefits

- **Shaping**: Helps tone and lift the glutes
- **Back-Friendly**: Done on all fours, gentle on spine
- **Functional**: Supports hip extension for walking

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

2. **Lifting too high** - Focus on glute squeeze
3. **Swinging leg** - Move with control

## Tips for Success
