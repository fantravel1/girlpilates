Heel Raises strengthen the calf muscles and improve ankle stability through a simple up-and-down movement.

## Rise and Lower

This classic exercise builds the lower leg muscles essential for walking and balance.

## Benefits

- **Calf Strength**: Builds gastrocnemius and soleus
- **Ankle Stability**: Improves joint strength
- **Balance**: Challenges equilibrium
- **Functional**: Important for daily activities

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rushing** - Move with control
2. **Leaning forward** - Stay upright
3. **Partial range** - Use full range of motion
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe naturally

## Tips for Success

- Focus on controlled lowering (eccentric phase)
- Keep weight even across all toes
- Progress to single-leg when ready
