Rollover Prep teaches the hip lift and abdominal scoop needed for the full rollover exercise.

## Lift to Prepare

This exercise builds the strength and control needed to safely progress to the full rollover.

## Benefits

- **Core Strength**: Deep lower abdominal work
- **Progression**: Prepares for full rollover
- **Control**: Teaches lift with control
- **Safety**: Builds strength before full inversion

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using momentum** - Lift with control, not swing
2. **Pressing into neck** - Keep neck relaxed, use arms
3. **Lifting too high** - This is prep, keep modest
4. **Forgetting to scoop** - Abs initiate the lift

## Tips for Success

- Press arms firmly into mat to assist
- Scoop your abs to initiate the lift
- Keep the movement controlled and small
