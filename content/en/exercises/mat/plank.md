The Plank is perhaps the most recognized core exercise in the world. In Pilates, we use it to build the foundation for many other exercises requiring core stability.

## The Foundation of Strength

A strong plank is essential for Leg Pull Front, Push-Up, and many other exercises. Master this first.

## Benefits

- **Core Strength**: Entire core works to maintain position
- **Shoulder Stability**: Arms support body weight
- **Full Body Integration**: Everything from head to heels engages
- **Posture**: Builds the muscles that keep you upright

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Hips sagging** - Engage glutes and abs
2. **Hips piking up** - Lower into straight line
3. **Head dropping** - Keep neck neutral
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe throughout

## Tips for Success

- Think of your body as one solid plank of wood
- Spread your fingers wide for more stability
- Quality always beats duration
