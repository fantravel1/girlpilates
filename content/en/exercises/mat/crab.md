The Crab is an advanced rolling exercise that adds ankle switching and a gentle head touch to the rolling pattern.

## Roll and Switch

This challenging exercise requires coordination, flexibility, and control to execute smoothly.

## Benefits

- **Rolling Control**: Masters spinal articulation
- **Coordination**: Times cross switch with roll
- **Flexibility**: Works in crossed leg position
- **Challenge**: Advanced full body exercise

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Heavy head touch** - Touch very lightly
2. **Rolling off center** - Stay on your spine
3. **Rushing** - Take time for the cross switch
4. **Forgetting to switch** - Remember to change cross each roll

## Tips for Success

- Keep your grip on your feet secure but not tight
- Switch your cross when legs are overhead
- Touch your head like a feather landing
