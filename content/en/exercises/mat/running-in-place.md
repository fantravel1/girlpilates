Running in Place brings cardio to the mat by creating a running motion while lying down, challenging core stability throughout.

## Run While Lying Down

This exercise adds a cardio element to mat work while maintaining core engagement and spinal stability.

## Benefits

- **Core Stability**: Maintains stable spine while legs move
- **Cardio Element**: Adds heart rate elevation
- **Foot Work**: Articulates through feet and ankles
- **Endurance**: Builds leg stamina

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Arching back** - Keep spine stable and neutral
2. **Choppy movement** - Create smooth, flowing rhythm
3. **Forgetting breath** - Keep breathing throughout
4. **Tensing shoulders** - Keep upper body relaxed

## Tips for Success

- Think of pushing your heel away like pressing a pedal
- Keep your core engaged to protect your back
- Find a steady rhythm and maintain it
