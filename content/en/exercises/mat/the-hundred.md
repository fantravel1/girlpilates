The Hundred is Joseph Pilates' signature exercise and the traditional opening of every classical Pilates mat routine. It's designed to warm up your body, engage your powerhouse (core), and coordinate your breath with movement.

## Why It's Called "The Hundred"

You pump your arms 100 times total while holding your core engaged. This creates internal heat and prepares your body for the exercises that follow.

## Benefits

- **Core Endurance**: Holding the position builds stamina in your deep abdominal muscles
- **Breath Coordination**: The rhythmic breathing pattern oxygenates your blood
- **Full Body Warm-Up**: Engages arms, core, and legs simultaneously
- **Mind-Body Connection**: Requires focus and concentration

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Tensing the neck** - Keep your gaze at your belly button, not the ceiling
2. **Holding your breath** - Maintain the 5-count inhale, 5-count exhale pattern
3. **Arching the lower back** - Press your lower back gently into the mat
4. **Pumping from shoulders** - Initiate the arm movement from your lats

## Tips for Success

- Start with the beginner modification and progress over time
- Quality over quantity - better to do 50 pumps with proper form than 100 with poor form
- Focus on the exhale to deepen your core engagement
