Clamshell is a classic rehabilitation and strengthening exercise for the hip abductors and external rotators.

## Open and Close

This simple side-lying movement targets muscles crucial for hip stability.

## Benefits

- **Hip Abductor Strength**: Targets outer hip
- **External Rotation**: Works deep hip muscles
- **Rehab Exercise**: Often prescribed for hip issues
- **Simple Setup**: Minimal equipment needed

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rolling backward** - Keep hips stacked vertically
2. **Lifting feet** - Feet stay together
3. **Using momentum** - Move slowly with control
4. **Opening too wide** - Maintain hip stability

## Tips for Success

- Imagine a wall behind you to prevent rolling
- Focus on the glute doing the work
- Keep core lightly engaged
