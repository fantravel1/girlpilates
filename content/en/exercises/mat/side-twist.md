Side Twist is a fundamental rotation exercise that improves spinal mobility while building oblique strength. This exercise teaches proper rotational mechanics.

## Rotate With Control

This exercise develops rotational mobility through the thoracic spine while keeping the lower body stable.

## Benefits

- **Spinal Rotation**: Improves rotational mobility
- **Oblique Strength**: Engages rotational muscles
- **Posture**: Promotes spinal awareness
- **Flexibility**: Increases thoracic mobility

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Hips rotating** - Keep pelvis stable
2. **Leaning back** - Stay tall throughout
3. **Rushing** - Move slowly with control
4. **Holding breath** - Exhale as you rotate

## Tips for Success

- Think of your spine as a spiral staircase
- Keep your sit bones equally weighted
- Lead the rotation from your ribs
