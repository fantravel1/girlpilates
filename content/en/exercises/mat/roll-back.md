Roll Back is a fundamental exercise that teaches the C-curve and builds abdominal control. This is a great preparation for more advanced rolling exercises.

## Control the Curve

This exercise develops the ability to maintain a rounded spine while moving, building the foundation for roll ups and other exercises.

## Benefits

- **Core Control**: Develops abdominal strength
- **Spinal Articulation**: Teaches C-curve
- **Foundation**: Prepares for advanced rolling
- **Awareness**: Builds mind-body connection

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Flat back** - Keep spine rounded in C-curve
2. **Going too far** - Stop at lower back
3. **Using momentum** - Roll with control
4. **Holding breath** - Exhale as you roll back

## Tips for Success

- Think of scooping your belly button to your spine
- Keep the curve in your spine throughout
- Use your exhale to initiate the roll
