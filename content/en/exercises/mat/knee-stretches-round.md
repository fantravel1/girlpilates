Knee Stretches Round is a challenging kneeling exercise that targets the core while maintaining a rounded spine position.

## Round and Strong

This exercise teaches you to maintain a rounded spine while the lower body moves, building tremendous core strength.

## Benefits

- **Core Strength**: Deep abdominal engagement
- **C-Curve Practice**: Maintains rounded spine
- **Hip Flexor Work**: Active hip flexion
- **Coordination**: Upper and lower body work together

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Flat back** - Keep spine rounded throughout
2. **Knees too high** - Just hover, don't lift high
3. **Arms bending** - Keep arms straight
4. **Losing the curve** - Focus on maintaining C-shape

## Tips for Success

- Scoop your belly button toward your spine
- Think of pushing away with your legs, not your arms
- Keep your gaze toward your belly
