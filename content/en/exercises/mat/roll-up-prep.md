Roll Up Prep builds the core strength and spinal articulation needed to perform the classic Roll Up. It's a stepping stone for beginners.

## Prepare for the Roll Up

The full Roll Up is challenging. This prep version allows you to build strength gradually while learning proper technique.

## Benefits

- **Core Strength**: Builds abdominal strength needed for Roll Up
- **Spinal Articulation**: Teaches vertebra-by-vertebra movement
- **Technique**: Establishes proper mechanics
- **Progression**: Bridge to more advanced exercises

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using momentum** - Roll slowly with control
2. **Neck strain** - Let abs do the work, not neck
3. **Flat back roll** - Maintain C-curve shape
4. **Holding breath** - Exhale as you roll up

## Tips for Success

- Think of peeling your spine off the mat one vertebra at a time
- Keep reaching forward with your arms throughout
- Your gaze should follow your hands, not look at ceiling
