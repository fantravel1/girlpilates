The Roll Up is one of the most challenging mat exercises and a true test of core strength. It requires controlled articulation of the spine - moving one vertebra at a time - which builds both strength and flexibility.

## Benefits

- **Core Strength**: Targets deep abdominal muscles
- **Spinal Mobility**: Improves vertebrae-by-vertebrae movement
- **Flexibility**: Stretches the entire back body
- **Control**: Develops mind-muscle connection

## Tips for Success

- Imagine peeling your spine off the mat like a wheel
- Keep your feet grounded throughout the movement
- Move slowly - momentum is cheating!
