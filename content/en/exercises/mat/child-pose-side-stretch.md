Child's Pose Side Stretch adds a lateral component to the classic resting pose for a wonderful side body stretch.

## Reach and Stretch

This gentle variation targets the often-neglected lateral line of the body.

## Benefits

- **Lat Stretch**: Opens the latissimus dorsi
- **Side Body**: Stretches obliques and intercostals
- **Restorative**: Calming and gentle
- **Hip Release**: Maintains child's pose benefits

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Lifting hips** - Keep hips back toward heels
2. **Holding breath** - Breathe into the stretch
3. **Rushing** - Take time on each side
4. **Forcing** - Stay in comfortable range

## Tips for Success

- Breathe deeply into the stretched side
- Keep both arms active and reaching
- Allow your body to relax into the pose
