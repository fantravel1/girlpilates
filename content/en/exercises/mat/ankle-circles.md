Ankle Circles are a simple but important mobility exercise that helps maintain flexibility and circulation in the ankles and feet.

## Don't Neglect Your Ankles

Ankle mobility affects your entire kinetic chain. Stiff ankles can contribute to knee, hip, and even back issues.

## Benefits

- **Ankle Mobility**: Improves range of motion
- **Circulation**: Increases blood flow to feet and ankles
- **Joint Health**: Helps maintain synovial fluid distribution
- **Injury Prevention**: Mobile ankles are more resilient

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Moving too fast** - Slow, controlled circles
2. **Not using full range** - Circle as large as possible
3. **Tensing leg** - Keep leg relaxed
4. **Forgetting both directions** - Circle both ways equally

## Tips for Success

- Think of drawing perfect circles with your big toe
- Keep the rest of your leg still - only ankle moves
- Do these daily for best results
