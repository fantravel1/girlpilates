Tricep Dips are an effective bodyweight exercise for building strength in the back of the arms. They can be done almost anywhere with a sturdy surface.

## Sculpt Your Arms

The triceps make up a large portion of your upper arm. Strong triceps support pushing movements and give arms a toned appearance.

## Benefits

- **Tricep Strength**: Directly targets the triceps
- **Upper Body Tone**: Sculpts the back of the arms
- **Functional**: Supports pushing movements in daily life
- **No Equipment**: Can be done with just bodyweight

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Elbows flaring** - Keep elbows pointing straight back
2. **Going too low** - Stop at 90-degree elbow bend
3. **Shoulders rising** - Keep shoulders down
4. **Using momentum** - Move with control

## Tips for Success

- Keep your hips close to the bench/chair
- Look straight ahead, not down
- Control the lowering phase - don't drop
