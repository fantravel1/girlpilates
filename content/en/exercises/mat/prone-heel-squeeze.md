Prone Heel Squeeze activates the inner thighs and glutes through an isometric squeezing action while lying face down.

## Squeeze and Activate

This exercise provides a unique way to work inner thighs and glutes simultaneously in the prone position.

## Benefits

- **Inner Thigh Activation**: Works adductors isometrically
- **Glute Engagement**: Activates gluteus maximus
- **Back-Friendly**: Gentle position for spine
- **Simple**: Easy to learn and perform

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-arching back** - Keep spine neutral
2. **Forgetting to breathe** - Breathe throughout
3. **Not engaging glutes** - Focus on both areas
4. **Rushing** - Take time with each squeeze

## Tips for Success

- Press your pubic bone into the mat for stability
- Think of drawing your inner thighs together
- Keep your core gently engaged
