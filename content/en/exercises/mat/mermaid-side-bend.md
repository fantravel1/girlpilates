The Mermaid Side Bend is a beautiful stretch that creates length through the lateral body. This seated exercise opens the side body and promotes spinal mobility.

## Lengthen and Reach

This stretch targets the often-tight lateral muscles, creating space between the ribs and promoting fuller breathing.

## Benefits

- **Lateral Stretch**: Opens entire side body
- **Rib Mobility**: Expands intercostal spaces
- **Spinal Mobility**: Promotes lateral flexion
- **Breath Enhancement**: Creates space for deeper breaths

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Collapsing** - Maintain length as you reach
2. **Rotating** - Keep chest facing forward initially
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe into the stretch
4. **Forcing** - Go only as far as comfortable

## Tips for Success

- Think of reaching up before reaching over
- Keep your opposite hip grounded
- Breathe into the stretching side
