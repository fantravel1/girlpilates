Quadruped Arm Reach challenges your core stability by removing one point of support. It teaches you to maintain a stable trunk while moving a limb.

## Stability Through Movement

This exercise trains your core to resist rotation and maintain alignment while one arm moves, building functional stability.

## Benefits

- **Core Stability**: Maintains neutral spine during arm movement
- **Balance**: Challenges three-point balance
- **Shoulder Mobility**: Extends shoulder through full range
- **Anti-Rotation**: Core works to prevent rotation

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Shifting weight** - Keep weight evenly distributed
2. **Rotating hips** - Keep hips level throughout
3. **Arching back** - Maintain neutral spine
4. **Rushing** - Slow, controlled movements

## Tips for Success

- Move slowly and with control
- Think of reaching your arm as long as possible
- Keep your neck in line with your spine
