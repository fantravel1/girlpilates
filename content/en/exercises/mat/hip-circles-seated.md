Hip Circles Seated is a simple mobilization exercise that warms up the hip joints and prepares them for more demanding movements.

## Mobilize Your Hips

This gentle exercise increases circulation to the hip joints and helps release any stiffness before working out.

## Benefits

- **Hip Mobility**: Loosens hip joints
- **Warm Up**: Prepares hips for movement
- **Circulation**: Increases blood flow to hips
- **Awareness**: Develops hip joint consciousness

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Moving too fast** - Circle slowly and smoothly
2. **Forcing range** - Stay within comfortable limits
3. **Tensing shoulders** - Keep upper body relaxed
4. **Uneven circles** - Make circles smooth and round

## Tips for Success

- Think of drawing smooth circles with your knees
- Keep the movement fluid and continuous
- Breathe naturally throughout
