Shoulder Stretch Prone provides a deep shoulder opening that stretches the rotator cuff and upper back.

## Roll and Open

This simple but effective stretch targets the often-tight shoulders and upper back muscles.

## Benefits

- **Shoulder Opening**: Stretches rotator cuff
- **Upper Back Release**: Opens tight back muscles
- **Chest Opening**: Stretches across chest
- **Relaxation**: Calming hold promotes relaxation

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forcing depth** - Go only as far as comfortable
2. **Holding breath** - Breathe deeply throughout
3. **Tensing shoulders** - Relax into the stretch
4. **Ignoring pain** - Stop if you feel sharp pain

## Tips for Success

- Roll slowly and mindfully
- Let gravity do the work
- Breathe into the stretched area
