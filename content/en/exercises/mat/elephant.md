The Elephant is a challenging pike position exercise that combines hamstring flexibility with deep core engagement. This exercise teaches you to maintain spinal flexion while under load.

## Round and Step

This exercise develops the ability to maintain a rounded spine while moving, building control that translates to many other Pilates exercises.

## Benefits

- **Hamstring Flexibility**: Deep stretch for back of legs
- **Core Engagement**: Requires strong abdominal contraction
- **Shoulder Stability**: Builds shoulder strength in weight-bearing
- **Spinal Articulation**: Maintains C-curve under load

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Flat back** - Keep spine deeply rounded
2. **Lifting head** - Let head hang naturally
3. **Heels lifting** - Reach heels toward floor
4. **Taking big steps** - Small, controlled movements

## Tips for Success

- Think of pulling your belly button to your spine
- Keep your weight mostly in your legs
- Move slowly and with control
