faq:
  - q: "My lower back arches during the circle. What should I do?"
    a: "Make your circles smaller and don't lower your legs as far. Your abs aren't strong enough yet for big circles."
  - q: "Should my hips lift off the mat?"
    a: "In the beginner version, no - keep hips grounded. Advanced Corkscrew allows the hips to lift and twist."
  - q: "How big should the circles be?"
    a: "Start small and increase as you get stronger. If your back arches, you've gone too big."

The Corkscrew challenges your core like few other exercises. As your legs circle, your obliques must work overtime to keep your torso completely still.

## The Ultimate Oblique Challenge

This exercise is deceptively difficult. The circling motion creates rotational forces that your core must resist, building incredible oblique strength.

## Benefits

- **Oblique Strength**: Fighting rotation builds powerful obliques
- **Hip Mobility**: Circles improve hip joint range of motion
- **Core Stability**: Keeping torso still while legs move
- **Coordination**: Smooth circles require concentration

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Circles too big** - Start small, grow gradually
2. **Back arching** - Keep lower back pressed into mat
3. **Uneven circles** - Make them symmetric both directions
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe throughout the circles

## Tips for Success

- Imagine your legs are drawing perfect circles on the ceiling
- Keep your shoulders and hips glued to the mat
- The power comes from your center, not your legs
