Side Plank is one of the most effective exercises for building lateral core strength. It challenges the obliques, shoulder stabilizers, and hip muscles all at once.

## Build Lateral Strength

While regular planks work the front of your core, side planks target the often-neglected sides, creating balanced core strength.

## Benefits

- **Oblique Strength**: Primary target is the side body
- **Shoulder Stability**: Supporting arm builds strength
- **Hip Strength**: Lateral hip muscles engage to hold position
- **Balance**: Challenges side-to-side stability

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Hips sagging** - Keep body in straight line
2. **Shoulder rolling forward** - Stack shoulder over elbow
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe throughout hold
4. **Hips rolling forward** - Keep hips stacked

## Tips for Success

- Create one long line from head to heels
- Push the floor away with your supporting arm
- Engage your whole core, not just obliques
