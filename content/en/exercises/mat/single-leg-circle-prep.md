Single Leg Circle Prep builds the hip mobility and core stability needed for the full Single Leg Circle. The bent support leg makes it more accessible.

## Build Hip Control

This exercise teaches you to move your leg independently from your pelvis - a fundamental skill for many Pilates exercises.

## Benefits

- **Hip Mobility**: Circles improve hip range of motion
- **Core Stability**: Pelvis must stay still during leg movement
- **Hip Flexor Strength**: Holding leg up builds strength
- **Coordination**: Challenges movement control

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Pelvis rocking** - Keep hips absolutely still
2. **Circles too big** - Start small, grow gradually
3. **Tensing upper body** - Keep shoulders relaxed
4. **Forgetting to reverse** - Circle both directions

## Tips for Success

- Anchor your pelvis by pressing arms into mat
- Think of drawing perfect circles on the ceiling
- Keep your neck long and relaxed
