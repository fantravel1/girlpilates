Inner Thigh Lifts target the often-neglected adductor muscles of the inner thigh. This exercise complements outer thigh work for balanced leg strength.

## Target the Adductors

The inner thigh muscles (adductors) are crucial for hip stability and proper leg alignment, yet they're often undertrained.

## Benefits

- **Inner Thigh Strength**: Directly targets adductor muscles
- **Hip Stability**: Strengthens muscles that support the hip joint
- **Leg Balance**: Complements outer thigh exercises
- **Knee Health**: Strong adductors help protect the knee

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rotating the hip** - Keep hip stacked, don't roll forward
2. **Bending the knee** - Keep bottom leg straight
3. **Using momentum** - Slow, controlled lifts
4. **Forgetting to breathe** - Exhale on the lift

## Tips for Success

- Think of reaching your foot away as you lift
- Keep your foot flexed to engage more of the inner thigh
- Quality over quantity - small movements done correctly are better
