faq:

    a: "You likely have an imbalance in your core. Focus on pulling both sides of your waist in equally."
  - q: "Can I roll onto my neck?"
    a: "Never roll onto your neck. Stop at the shoulder blades. The roll should feel like a gentle spinal massage."
  - q: "I can't balance at the top. Any tips?"
    a: "Scoop your abs deeper and think of pulling your heels toward your seat. The tighter your ball, the easier to balance."

Rolling Like a Ball is one of the most joyful exercises in Pilates. It reconnects us to the playful movement we knew as children while massaging the spine.

## Find Your Inner Child

This exercise should feel good! The rolling action massages each vertebra while the core works to control the movement.

## Benefits

- **Spinal Massage**: Rolling massages the muscles along the spine
- **Balance Challenge**: Finding equilibrium on your tailbone
- **Core Control**: Using abs to initiate and stop the roll
- **Stress Relief**: The rocking motion is naturally calming

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rolling onto neck** - Stop at shoulder blades every time
2. **Using momentum** - Control the roll with your abs
3. **Loosening the ball shape** - Stay tightly curled throughout
4. **Throwing head back** - Keep chin tucked to chest

## Tips for Success

- Think of your spine as a wheel rolling evenly
- The tighter you curl, the smoother you'll roll
- Use your exhale to power the roll up to seated
