Spine Corrector Stretch brings the benefits of the spine corrector apparatus to mat work using a simple rolled towel.

## Open and Release

This stretch counteracts forward-rounded postures by gently extending the thoracic spine.

## Benefits

- **Chest Opening**: Stretches tight pectorals
- **Thoracic Extension**: Opens upper back
- **Shoulder Release**: Allows shoulders to drop back
- **Breathing**: Improves rib cage expansion

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Roll too low** - Keep in upper back, not lower
2. **Tensing up** - Relax and breathe into stretch
3. **Too long** - Start with short holds
4. **Forcing arms back** - Let arms rest where comfortable

## Tips for Success

- Place roll at about bra-strap level
- Let gravity do the work
- Breathe deeply into your chest
