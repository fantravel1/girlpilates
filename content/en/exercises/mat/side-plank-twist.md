Side Plank Twist combines the stability challenge of side plank with dynamic rotation for complete core engagement.

## Twist and Stabilize

This advanced exercise requires maintaining plank alignment while adding controlled rotation.

## Benefits

- **Deep Oblique Work**: Rotation intensifies side body engagement
- **Shoulder Stability**: Supporting arm works hard
- **Core Integration**: Full core activation required
- **Coordination**: Combines stability with movement

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Hips dropping** - Keep hips lifted throughout
2. **Rushing rotation** - Move with control
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe smoothly
4. **Losing alignment** - Keep body in one plane

## Tips for Success

- Initiate the twist from your waist, not your arm
- Keep your supporting shoulder stable
- Think of wringing out your core with each rotation
