Corkscrew Prep develops the core control needed for the full Corkscrew exercise. This preparation keeps the movement smaller while building strength and control.

## Circle With Stability

This exercise teaches you to move your legs in circles while keeping your spine stable on the mat.

## Benefits

- **Core Control**: Maintains spine position during circles
- **Oblique Work**: Engages obliques to control rotation
- **Hip Mobility**: Circles through full hip range
- **Preparation**: Builds toward full Corkscrew

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Back lifting** - Keep lower back on mat
2. **Circles too big** - Start small
3. **Losing control** - Slow down
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe continuously

## Tips for Success

- Press your arms into the mat for stability
- Keep your legs squeezed together
- Think of drawing perfect circles on the ceiling
