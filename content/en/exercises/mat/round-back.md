Round Back teaches the fundamental C-curve shape used throughout Pilates. This seated exercise builds abdominal strength and spinal awareness while creating deep flexion through the spine.

## Create Your C-Curve

The round back position is a foundational Pilates shape that appears in many exercises. Learning to maintain this active curve builds core strength and control.

## Benefits

- **Core Engagement**: Deep abdominal activation
- **Spinal Flexion**: Creates healthy flexion mobility
- **Body Awareness**: Teaches the C-curve shape
- **Foundation**: Prepares for rolling exercises

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Passive rounding** - Stay active through the curve
2. **Shoulders tensing** - Keep shoulders relaxed
3. **Losing lower back curve** - Round evenly through spine
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe into your back

## Tips for Success

- Think of scooping your belly button toward your spine
- Create even roundness from tailbone to head
- Feel your back stretch as you curve
