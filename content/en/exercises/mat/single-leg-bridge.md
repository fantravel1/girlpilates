Single Leg Bridge doubles the demand on your working leg by removing support from one side. It's an excellent progression from regular bridge.

## One Leg, Double the Work

By lifting one leg, you force the other leg and glute to do all the work, creating significant strength gains.

## Benefits

- **Glute Strength**: Working leg gets intense activation
- **Hamstring Power**: Single leg increases hamstring demand
- **Hip Stability**: Core works to prevent rotation
- **Leg Strength**: Builds single-leg power

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Hips dropping to one side** - Keep them level
2. **Arching lower back** - Maintain neutral spine
3. **Rushing** - Control both lift and lower
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe throughout

## Tips for Success

- Press firmly through the heel of your standing foot
- Keep your extended leg active, reaching toward ceiling
- Focus on squeezing the glute of your standing leg
