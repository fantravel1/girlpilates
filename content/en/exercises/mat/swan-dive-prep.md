Swan Dive Prep builds the back strength and timing needed for the dynamic Swan Dive exercise. This preparation teaches you to maintain extension without hand support.

## Prepare to Dive

This exercise develops the strength to hold your back extension without hands, preparing you for the rocking motion of the full Swan Dive.

## Benefits

- **Back Strength**: Builds spinal extensor muscles
- **Coordination**: Times the hand lift with extension
- **Control**: Maintains position without hand support
- **Preparation**: Builds toward full Swan Dive

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-extending** - Keep within comfortable range
2. **Forgetting glutes** - Engage glutes to protect spine
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe throughout
4. **Rushing** - Take time with each lift

## Tips for Success

- Squeeze your glutes before extending
- Think of lengthening your spine, not compressing
- Keep your neck long and gaze forward
