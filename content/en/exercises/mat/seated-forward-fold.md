Seated Forward Fold is a classic stretch that targets the entire back body, from calves to spine.

## Fold and Lengthen

This calming stretch releases tension in the hamstrings and lower back while encouraging deep breathing.

## Benefits

- **Hamstring Stretch**: Lengthens back of thighs
- **Spinal Release**: Stretches entire back
- **Calming**: Promotes relaxation
- **Flexibility**: Improves overall flexibility

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rounding back** - Keep spine long as you fold
2. **Forcing depth** - Go only as far as comfortable
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe deeply into stretch
4. **Bouncing** - Hold steadily, don't bounce

## Tips for Success

- Think of lengthening your spine before folding
- Lead with your chest, not your head
- Let gravity help deepen the stretch over time
