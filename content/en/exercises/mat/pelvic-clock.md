Pelvic Clock develops awareness and control of your pelvis through subtle movements. The clock visualization makes it easier to explore all directions of pelvic motion.

## Find Your Foundation

The pelvis is the foundation of your core. Understanding how it moves in all directions is essential for proper Pilates technique.

## Benefits

- **Pelvic Awareness**: Develops sensitivity to pelvic position
- **Mobility**: Explores full range of pelvic movement
- **Foundation**: Essential for understanding neutral spine
- **Relaxation**: Gentle movements release tension

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Moving too much** - Keep movements small and subtle
2. **Moving legs** - Only pelvis should move
3. **Tensing** - Stay relaxed throughout
4. **Rushing** - Move slowly to feel each position

## Tips for Success

- Really visualize the clock face on your pelvis
- Each movement should be barely visible from outside
- This is meditation in motion - be present with the sensations
