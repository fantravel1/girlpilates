Seated Twist improves spinal mobility through controlled rotation while maintaining an upright posture.

## Rotate with Length

This accessible exercise enhances spinal rotation while teaching proper alignment.

## Benefits

- **Spinal Mobility**: Improves thoracic rotation
- **Oblique Engagement**: Activates side muscles
- **Posture Awareness**: Reinforces upright spine
- **Digestion Aid**: May help digestive function

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rounding spine** - Stay tall throughout
2. **Forcing rotation** - Keep it gentle
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe naturally
4. **Leaning back** - Maintain upright position

## Tips for Success

- Grow taller before you twist
- Lead with your chest, not your shoulders
- Keep both sit bones grounded
