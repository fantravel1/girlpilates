Control Balance is one of the most advanced exercises in the Pilates mat repertoire. It requires mastery of shoulder stand plus the ability to control leg movements while inverted.

## Mastery Level

This exercise is a graduation exercise - it shows you've developed the strength, flexibility, and control that Pilates develops.

## Benefits

- **Ultimate Control**: Moving limbs while inverted
- **Balance Mastery**: Finding stability in an unstable position
- **Hamstring Flexibility**: The leg reach requires long hamstrings
- **Core Strength**: Maintaining shoulder stand with movement

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rushing** - This requires slow, precise movement
2. **Straining neck** - Weight on shoulders, not neck
3. **Losing alignment** - Keep hips stacked over shoulders
4. **Holding breath** - Continue breathing throughout

## Tips for Success

- Master shoulder stand before attempting this
- Keep one point fixed (the standing leg) while the other moves
- Think of your core as the anchor for all movement
