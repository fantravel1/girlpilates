Knee Circles is a gentle hip mobility exercise that helps lubricate the hip joints and release tension. It's perfect for warming up or cooling down.

## Mobility for Healthy Hips

The circular motion helps distribute synovial fluid throughout the hip joint, promoting joint health and mobility.

## Benefits

- **Hip Mobility**: Improves range of motion in hips
- **Joint Lubrication**: Helps distribute synovial fluid
- **Tension Release**: Relaxes tight hip muscles
- **Warm-Up**: Perfect preparation for other exercises

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Circles too big** - Start small, grow gradually
2. **Tensing shoulders** - Keep upper body relaxed
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe naturally throughout
4. **Jerky movements** - Keep circles smooth

## Tips for Success

- Let your hands guide your knees gently
- Keep your lower back connected to the mat
- This should feel good - never painful
