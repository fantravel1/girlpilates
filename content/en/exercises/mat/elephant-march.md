Elephant March is a gentle warm-up exercise that stretches the hamstrings and calves through an alternating marching motion.

## March and Stretch

This exercise warms up the entire back body while gently mobilizing the spine and stretching the legs.

## Benefits

- **Hamstring Stretch**: Lengthens back of thighs
- **Calf Work**: Stretches calves alternately
- **Spinal Release**: Lets spine hang and decompress
- **Warm Up**: Great preparation for leg work

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Locking knees** - Keep soft bend in knees
2. **Rushing** - Take time with each heel press
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe naturally
4. **Forcing range** - Work within comfortable range

## Tips for Success

- Let your head hang heavy and relaxed
- Press through the heel to feel the stretch
- Think of walking in place while folded over
