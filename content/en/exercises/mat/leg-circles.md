faq:
  - q: "My hips rock when I circle. What am I doing wrong?"
    a: "Your circles are too big. Make them smaller until you can keep your pelvis still."
  - q: "Should my leg be completely straight?"
    a: "Ideally yes, but a soft knee is fine if hamstrings are tight."
  - q: "Which direction should I circle first?"
    a: "Traditionally, across the body first (inward), then outward. But consistency matters more than direction."

Leg Circles (or Single Leg Circles) is one of the first exercises in the classical Pilates sequence. It teaches the fundamental skill of moving the leg independently from the pelvis.

## Hip Mobility Meets Core Stability

The challenge is keeping your torso completely still while your leg moves through its full range of motion. This dissociation is key to functional movement.

## Benefits

- **Hip Mobility**: Circles improve range of motion in the hip joint
- **Core Stability**: Maintaining stillness challenges deep abs
- **Hamstring Flexibility**: Leg extended stretches the hamstring
- **Body Awareness**: Learn to isolate hip from pelvis

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Pelvis rocking** - Make circles smaller
2. **Holding breath** - Breathe naturally throughout
3. **Circles too fast** - Slow, controlled movement
4. **Losing leg height** - Return to starting position each circle

## Tips for Success

- Anchor your opposite hip into the mat
- Think of drawing circles on the ceiling with your big toe
- Quality over size - small controlled circles beat big sloppy ones
