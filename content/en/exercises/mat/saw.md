faq:
  - q: "Both sitting bones should stay down?"
    a: "Yes! The challenge is to rotate without lifting either hip. Anchor through your sit bones."
  - q: "What does 'sawing' mean?"
    a: "Small pulsing movements past the pinky toe, like you're sawing off your little toe (gently!)."
  - q: "I feel dizzy when I twist. Is this normal?"
    a: "Move slower and breathe consistently. If dizziness persists, skip rotational exercises and consult a doctor."

The Saw combines rotation with forward flexion, creating a wonderful wringing-out sensation for the spine. It's like giving your internal organs a massage.

## Twist and Reach

The rotation comes first, then the forward reach. This sequence maximizes the stretch while protecting the spine.

## Benefits

- **Spinal Rotation**: Improves rotational mobility
- **Waist Definition**: Works the obliques intensely
- **Hamstring Stretch**: Deep stretch for back of legs
- **Detoxification**: Twisting massages internal organs

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Lifting the hip** - Keep both sit bones firmly grounded
2. **Rotating from shoulders only** - Twist from your waist
3. **Collapsing the chest** - Keep heart lifted even while rounding
4. **Rushing the rotation** - Take time to fully rotate before reaching

## Tips for Success

- Imagine wringing out a wet towel - that's the sensation in your waist
- Keep the back arm reaching long behind you as you reach forward
- Opposition is key: one arm forward, one arm back
