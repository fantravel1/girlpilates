Side Lying Leg Lift is a classic exercise for strengthening the outer thighs and hip abductors.

## Lift to the Side

This targeted exercise isolates the outer hip muscles that are important for hip stability and walking.

## Benefits

- **Outer Thigh Work**: Targets hip abductors
- **Hip Stability**: Strengthens stabilizing muscles
- **Accessible**: Simple movement for all levels
- **Toning**: Helps shape outer thigh

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rolling back** - Keep body in straight line
2. **Lifting too high** - Stay at or below hip height
3. **Pointing leg forward** - Lift straight to side
4. **Forgetting to breathe** - Breathe naturally

## Tips for Success

- Lead with your heel as you lift
- Keep your hips stacked throughout
- Move slowly and with control
