Bicycle Crunch is one of the most effective exercises for targeting both the rectus abdominis and the obliques. The twisting motion combined with leg movement creates comprehensive core work.

## Pedal Your Way to Strong Abs

The rotation and reciprocal leg movement make this exercise highly effective for building overall core strength and definition.

## Benefits

- **Oblique Activation**: Rotation targets the obliques
- **Rectus Abdominis**: Crunching works the six-pack muscles
- **Coordination**: Requires opposite arm/leg coordination
- **Core Endurance**: High rep exercise builds stamina

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Pulling on neck** - Hands support, don't pull
2. **Racing through reps** - Slower is more effective
3. **Hip flexors taking over** - Focus on the twist, not the legs
4. **Elbow to knee only** - Focus on rotating your ribcage

## Tips for Success

- Think of bringing your armpit to your opposite knee, not just elbow
- Keep your lower back pressed into the mat
- Quality over speed - make each rep count
