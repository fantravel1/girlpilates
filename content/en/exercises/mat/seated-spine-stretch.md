Seated Spine Stretch is a classic Pilates exercise that lengthens the spine and stretches the posterior chain.

## Reach and Round

This fundamental stretch combines spinal flexion with hamstring lengthening.

## Benefits

- **Spine Mobility**: Creates space between vertebrae
- **Hamstring Flexibility**: Stretches back of legs
- **Back Release**: Relieves tension
- **Breath Connection**: Encourages deep breathing

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Holding breath** - Breathe into the stretch
2. **Collapsing chest** - Keep reaching forward
3. **Forcing depth** - Respect your limits
4. **Rushing** - Take time to stretch

## Tips for Success

- Think of curling over a ball
- Keep feet flexed to increase hamstring stretch
- Breathe deeply throughout
