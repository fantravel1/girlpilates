faq:
  - q: "What's the difference between Pelvic Curl and Shoulder Bridge?"
    a: "They're very similar. Pelvic Curl emphasizes the articulation, while Shoulder Bridge often includes leg variations."
  - q: "I feel this mostly in my lower back. Is that right?"
    a: "You should feel it in your glutes and hamstrings. If lower back dominates, focus on posterior tilt and ab engagement."
  - q: "How high should I lift?"
    a: "Until there's a straight line from shoulders to knees. Don't over-arch."

Pelvic Curl is the gateway exercise for spinal articulation. It teaches you to feel and control each vertebra while building fundamental strength.

## The Spine's Introduction

Before you can do advanced rolling exercises, you need to understand how your spine moves. Pelvic Curl is the perfect teacher.

## Benefits

- **Spinal Articulation**: Feel each vertebra move
- **Glute Strength**: Primary movers are the glutes
- **Hip Flexor Stretch**: Opens the front of the hips
- **Foundation Building**: Prepares you for advanced bridging

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Lifting too high** - Keep ribs connected to hips
2. **Rushing** - Take time to feel each vertebra
3. **Overusing lower back** - Lead with glutes
4. **Holding breath** - Exhale to lift, inhale to lower

## Tips for Success

- Think of your spine as a strand of pearls lifting one at a time
- Press through your whole foot, not just heels
- The roll-down is just as important as the roll-up
