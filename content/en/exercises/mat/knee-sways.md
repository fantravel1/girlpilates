faq:
  - q: "My shoulder lifts when my knees drop. Is that okay?"
    a: "Reduce the range until shoulders stay down - mobility will improve."

    a: "Only as far as shoulders stay grounded and movement feels comfortable."

Knee Sways provide gentle spinal rotation that releases tension in the lower back while improving rotational mobility. It's a wonderful exercise for warming up or cooling down.

## Gentle Rotation for Release

This exercise uses gravity to gently rotate the spine while the upper body stays anchored, creating a safe and effective stretch through the lower back.

## Benefits

- **Spinal Rotation**: Improves rotational mobility
- **Lower Back Release**: Gently stretches lumbar spine
- **Hip Mobility**: Opens hip rotators
- **Relaxation**: Calming, rhythmic movement

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Shoulders lifting** - Keep both shoulders anchored
2. **Moving too fast** - Slow, controlled movement
3. **Forcing range** - Stay within comfortable limits
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe naturally throughout

## Tips for Success

- Let gravity do the work
- Move with your breath - exhale as knees drop
- Keep the movement smooth and rhythmic
