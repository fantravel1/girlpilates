The Side Kick Series is a comprehensive set of side-lying exercises that work the hips through multiple planes of motion. This series builds hip strength, mobility, and stability.

## Complete Hip Workout

This series targets all the muscles around the hip through front/back kicks, up/down lifts, and circles.

## Benefits

- **Hip Strength**: Works all hip muscles
- **Mobility**: Moves hip through full range
- **Stability**: Challenges core to maintain position
- **Balance**: Develops single-leg stability

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rolling forward or back** - Keep hips stacked
2. **Using momentum** - Control all movements
3. **Tensing shoulders** - Keep upper body relaxed
4. **Forgetting core** - Maintain core engagement

## Tips for Success

- Keep your top hip stacked directly over your bottom hip
- Use your core to stabilize your trunk
- Move through full range with control
