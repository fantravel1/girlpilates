Double Leg Lower Lift is an advanced core exercise that challenges the lower abdominals to stabilize the spine while the legs move through a large range.

## Deep Core Challenge

This exercise requires significant core strength to prevent the lower back from arching as the legs lower. It's one of the most challenging ab exercises.

## Benefits

- **Lower Ab Strength**: Targets the deep lower abdominals
- **Core Stability**: Challenges spine stabilization
- **Hip Flexor Strength**: Works through full hip range
- **Control**: Develops precise movement control

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Back arching** - Keep lower back pressed into mat
2. **Going too low** - Reduce range if back lifts
3. **Using momentum** - Move slowly with control
4. **Holding breath** - Exhale as legs lower

## Tips for Success

- Press your lower back into the mat throughout
- Start with smaller range and progress gradually
- Hands under hips can help protect the back
