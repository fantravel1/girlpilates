Spine Twist is a deceptively simple exercise that challenges your rotational mobility. The key is isolating the rotation to your thoracic spine while keeping your hips completely still.

## Pure Rotation

Unlike many twisting exercises, Spine Twist eliminates any forward flexion. It's a pure rotational movement that targets thoracic mobility.

## Benefits

- **Spinal Rotation**: Improves ability to twist from the mid-back
- **Oblique Activation**: Works the rotational muscles of the core
- **Postural Strength**: Maintaining tall spine builds back muscles
- **Breath Coordination**: Exhale deepens the rotation

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Moving the hips** - Keep them absolutely still
2. **Collapsing the spine** - Stay lifted throughout
3. **Leading with arms** - Initiate from your waist
4. **Holding breath** - Use breath to assist rotation

## Tips for Success

- Imagine a rod running through your spine to keep you tall
- Think of wringing out your torso like a wet towel
- Keep energy reaching through your fingertips
