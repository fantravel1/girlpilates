Kneeling Side Kicks add a balance challenge to the traditional side kicks. The reduced base of support means your core works harder to keep you stable.

## Balance Plus Strength

By taking away the stability of lying down, this exercise doubles as a balance and strength challenge.

## Benefits

- **Balance Challenge**: Reduced base requires more stabilization
- **Hip Strength**: Same benefits as lying side kicks
- **Oblique Work**: Core must work to prevent tipping
- **Functional Strength**: More applicable to daily movement

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Collapsing into shoulder** - Press away from the floor
2. **Hip rotating** - Keep hips stacked
3. **Rushing** - Controlled movement only
4. **Forgetting to breathe** - Exhale on the kick

## Tips for Success

- Think of your body as a straight line from head to knee
- Keep your supporting arm strong but not locked
- The kick should feel like a controlled swing, not a throw
