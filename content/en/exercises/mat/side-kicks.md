faq:
  - q: "My body rocks back and forth. How do I stop this?"
    a: "Reduce the range of your kick. Your torso stability is more important than leg height or reach."

    a: "You should feel your outer hip and glute on the working leg, plus your obliques stabilizing."

Side Kicks are a staple of every Pilates mat class. This side-lying series builds hip strength, glute definition, and challenges your core to keep you stable.

## The Side-Lying Series

Traditionally, Side Kicks include several variations: front/back, up/down, circles, and more. Master the basic kick first before adding variations.

## Benefits

- **Hip Strength**: Targets the outer hip and glute medius
- **Core Stability**: Your obliques work overtime to keep you still
- **Hip Mobility**: Increases range of motion in the hip joint
- **Balance**: Trains lateral stability

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rocking the torso** - Keep your body like a plank of wood
2. **Lifting the hip** - Stack and maintain hip alignment
3. **Holding breath** - Exhale on the kick forward
4. **Letting leg drop** - Maintain hip-height throughout

## Tips for Success

- Imagine your body is between two panes of glass
- Quality over quantity - controlled, precise movements
- Think of reaching your leg long rather than kicking high
