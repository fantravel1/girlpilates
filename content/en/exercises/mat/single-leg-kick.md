Single Leg Kick is a rhythmic prone exercise that works the back body while stretching the front of the thighs. The double pulse gives it a distinctive beat.

## Kick with a Beat

The rhythm of this exercise - kick-kick, kick-kick - makes it almost dance-like. The tempo keeps your mind engaged while your body works.

## Benefits

- **Back Strength**: Maintaining the prop position builds back muscles
- **Quad Stretch**: Kicking heel to seat stretches the front of thigh
- **Hamstring Strength**: The kick engages the hamstrings
- **Coordination**: Alternating rhythm challenges coordination

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-arching back** - Keep abs engaged
2. **Sinking into shoulders** - Press forearms down, lift chest up
3. **Losing rhythm** - Keep the beat consistent
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe with the rhythm

## Tips for Success

- Think of your legs as pendulums swinging with control
- Keep your chest lifted throughout - don't bob up and down
- The kick comes from your hamstrings, not your lower back
