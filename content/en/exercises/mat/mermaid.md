faq:
  - q: "My hips keep lifting. Is that okay?"
    a: "Try to keep both sit bones grounded, but a small lift is natural. Focus more on the stretch than staying perfectly still."

    a: "Start with your tighter side. Most people have one side that needs more attention."
  - q: "Can I do this standing?"
    a: "Yes! Standing Mermaid is a great variation for the office or when you need a quick stretch."

The Mermaid is one of the most graceful exercises in Pilates. It creates space between your ribs, lengthens your side body, and feels absolutely wonderful.

## Create Space in Your Body

We rarely move in pure side-bending in daily life. Mermaid addresses this neglected movement pattern, opening up the entire lateral line.

## Benefits

- **Intercostal Stretch**: Opens the muscles between your ribs
- **Spinal Lateral Flexion**: Increases side-bending mobility
- **Shoulder Opening**: Stretches the shoulder of the reaching arm
- **Breath Expansion**: Creates more room for deep breathing

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Collapsing forward** - Keep chest open, bend purely to the side
2. **Tensing shoulders** - Let the reaching arm be long and relaxed
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe into the stretch
4. **Rushing** - Luxuriate in this stretch

## Tips for Success

- Imagine your spine arcing like a rainbow
- Reach through your fingertips as you bend
- Let each breath deepen the stretch naturally
