The Shoulder Stand is an inverted position that builds core strength while offering the benefits of inversion. This pose serves as preparation for many advanced Pilates exercises.

## Invert With Support

This exercise teaches you to stack your body in an inverted position with hand support, building strength and balance.

## Benefits
