Footwork is a fundamental Pilates exercise that develops leg strength while teaching core stability. This exercise is adapted from the reformer for mat practice.

## Build Your Foundation

This exercise works the legs through extension and flexion while challenging the core to maintain stability.

## Benefits

- **Leg Strength**: Works quads, hamstrings, and calves
- **Foot Articulation**: Practices different foot positions
- **Core Stability**: Maintains neutral spine during movement
- **Foundation**: Prepares for more complex leg exercises

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Back arching** - Keep lower back pressed into mat
2. **Rushing** - Move with control
3. **Forgetting feet** - Be intentional with foot position
4. **Holding breath** - Exhale on extension

## Tips for Success

- Press your lower back gently into the mat
- Extend your legs as one unit
- Articulate through your feet with intention
