Hip Circles is a show-stopping exercise that combines balance, core strength, and hip mobility. When performed with hips lifted, it's one of the most challenging mat exercises.

## Balance Meets Strength

This exercise demands everything: arm strength to support your weight, core strength to control the circles, and hip mobility to make them smooth.

## Benefits

- **Core Strength**: Controlling circles while balanced
- **Hip Mobility**: Full circular range of motion
- **Arm Strength**: Supporting body weight throughout
- **Balance**: Maintaining position while legs move

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Collapsing shoulders** - Keep chest lifted
2. **Rushing circles** - Slow, controlled movements
3. **Holding breath** - Keep breathing throughout
4. **Uneven circles** - Make them symmetric

## Tips for Success

- Build up to the full exercise - start with hips down
- Keep your chest proud and shoulders back
- The circles should be smooth, not jerky
