  - q: "I feel pressure on my neck. Is that normal?"
    a: "No - the weight should be on your shoulders and upper back. If your neck hurts, you're going too far."

Roll Over is a classical Pilates inversion that challenges spinal articulation and core strength. It's the foundation for more advanced exercises like Jackknife and Control Balance.

## The Spine Sequencer

This exercise demands that you feel and control each vertebra as you roll up and down. It's like a massage for your spine from the inside.

## Benefits

- **Spinal Articulation**: Ultimate control of each vertebra
- **Core Strength**: Abs work hard to control the movement
- **Hamstring Stretch**: Legs overhead stretches hamstrings
- **Inversion Benefits**: Reverses blood flow, decompresses spine

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using momentum** - Control the roll with your abs
2. **Weight on neck** - Keep weight on shoulders
3. **Rushing the roll-down** - Feel each vertebra
4. **Holding breath** - Exhale over, inhale down

## Tips for Success

- Press arms firmly into mat for support
- Think of peeling your spine off the mat like tape
- The slower you go, the more control you build
