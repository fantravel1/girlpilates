Knee Fold is a fundamental exercise that teaches you to move your legs while maintaining pelvic stability. It's the building block for many Pilates exercises.

## Master the Basics

This simple movement establishes the core control needed for more advanced leg work. Don't skip this foundation!

## Benefits

- **Core Stability**: Teaches pelvis control during leg movement
- **Awareness**: Develops mind-body connection
- **Foundation**: Prepares for all leg exercises
- **Hip Flexor Control**: Trains proper hip flexion

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Pelvis tilting** - Keep pelvis stable in neutral
2. **Back flattening** - Maintain small natural curve
3. **Rushing** - Move slowly with control
4. **Holding breath** - Coordinate breath with movement

## Tips for Success

- Imagine your pelvis is a bowl of water - don't spill it
- Keep your foot relaxed as you lift
- The movement should feel effortless when done correctly
