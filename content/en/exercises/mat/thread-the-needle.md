Thread the Needle is a wonderful thoracic mobility exercise that stretches the upper back and shoulders while teaching rotational movement from the mid-spine.

## Unlock Your Upper Back

Many people are stiff in the thoracic spine from sitting. This exercise opens up that area and creates space between the vertebrae.

## Benefits

- **Thoracic Mobility**: Improves rotation in the mid-back
- **Shoulder Stretch**: Opens the shoulder of the reaching arm
- **Upper Back Relief**: Releases tension between shoulder blades
- **Spinal Health**: Promotes healthy rotational movement

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forcing the rotation** - Let it be gentle
2. **Holding breath** - Breathe deeply into the stretch
3. **Moving from lower back** - Rotation should come from upper back
4. **Rushing** - Hold and breathe in the stretched position

## Tips for Success

- Think of your ribs spiraling toward the ceiling
- Keep your hips squared over your knees
- Use exhales to deepen the stretch naturally
