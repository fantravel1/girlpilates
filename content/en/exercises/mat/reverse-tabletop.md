Reverse Tabletop strengthens the entire back side of the body - glutes, hamstrings, and back muscles - while opening the chest and shoulders.

## Strengthen the Back Body

This exercise targets muscles that are often weak from sitting, helping to counteract forward-hunched posture.

## Benefits

- **Glute Activation**: Lifting hips engages glutes
- **Hamstring Strength**: Back of legs work to hold position
- **Chest Opening**: Front of shoulders and chest stretch
- **Wrist Strength**: Supports and strengthens wrists

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Hips sagging** - Lift and hold hips level
2. **Shoulders by ears** - Keep shoulders down
3. **Neck straining** - Keep neck neutral
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe throughout

## Tips for Success

- Squeeze your glutes to help lift higher
- Press through your whole hand, not just the heel of your palm
- Think of your body as one solid line from shoulders to knees
