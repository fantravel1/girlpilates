Stomach Massage Prep teaches the rounded spine position used in the classical reformer exercise. This mat version builds abdominal strength while maintaining a deep C-curve.

## Scoop and Lift

This exercise challenges you to maintain spinal flexion while adding movement, building the core control needed for the full Stomach Massage series.

## Benefits

- **Deep Core Work**: Intense abdominal engagement
- **C-Curve Control**: Maintains flexion under load
- **Hip Flexor Strength**: Lifts legs against gravity
- **Preparation**: Builds toward reformer exercise

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Straightening spine** - Keep C-curve throughout
2. **Shoulders rising** - Keep shoulders relaxed
3. **Gripping neck** - Relax neck and jaw
4. **Losing balance** - Stay centered on sit bones

## Tips for Success

- Think of your belly button pulling toward your spine
- Use your hands for support initially
- Move feet slowly to maintain control
