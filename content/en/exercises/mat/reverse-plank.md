Reverse Plank strengthens the entire posterior chain while opening the front of the body and shoulders.

## Flip Your Plank

This exercise reverses the traditional plank to challenge the back body and open the chest and shoulders.

## Benefits

- **Posterior Chain**: Strengthens entire back body
- **Shoulder Opening**: Stretches front of shoulders
- **Hip Extension**: Works glutes and hamstrings
- **Arm Strength**: Builds triceps strength

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Sagging hips** - Lift hips high, create straight line
2. **Head dropping back** - Keep head in neutral alignment
3. **Locked elbows** - Keep slight softness in arms
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe steadily throughout

## Tips for Success

- Press firmly through your palms
- Squeeze your glutes to lift hips
- Think of pushing your chest toward the ceiling
