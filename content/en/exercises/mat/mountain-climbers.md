Mountain Climbers combine plank stability with cardio-intensive leg movement for a full-body challenge.

## Run in Place

This dynamic exercise elevates heart rate while building core strength and endurance.

## Benefits

- **Cardio Conditioning**: Raises heart rate
- **Core Stability**: Maintains plank throughout
- **Hip Flexor Strength**: Driving knees builds strength
- **Full Body**: Engages multiple muscle groups

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Hips too high** - Keep body in straight line
2. **Bouncing** - Stay controlled
3. **Forgetting to breathe** - Breathe rhythmically
4. **Sagging hips** - Maintain plank alignment

## Tips for Success

- Start slow and build speed gradually
- Keep core tight throughout
- Land lightly on your toes
