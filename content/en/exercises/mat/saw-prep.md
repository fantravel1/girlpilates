The Saw Prep introduces the combination of spinal rotation and forward flexion. This exercise prepares the body for the full Saw while building rotational mobility and hamstring flexibility.

## Rotate and Reach

This preparatory exercise teaches you to maintain pelvic stability while rotating the spine and reaching forward, a key skill for the classical Saw exercise.

## Benefits

- **Rotational Mobility**: Increases spine rotation ability
- **Hamstring Stretch**: Lengthens back of legs
- **Oblique Engagement**: Works rotational core muscles
- **Breath Coordination**: Links movement with exhale

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Lifting hip** - Keep both sit bones grounded
2. **Rounding before rotating** - Rotate first, then round forward
3. **Collapsing chest** - Maintain length as you rotate
4. **Forcing reach** - Go only as far as flexibility allows

## Tips for Success

- Think of wringing out your spine like a wet towel
- Exhale as you reach forward
- Keep back arm lifted and active
