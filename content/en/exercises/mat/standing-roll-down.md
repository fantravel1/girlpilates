Standing Roll Down is one of the most fundamental exercises in Pilates. It teaches spinal articulation in a functional, standing position that you can do anywhere.

## The Everyday Spine Check

This exercise is perfect for morning wake-ups, desk breaks, or any time you need to decompress your spine and check in with your body.

## Benefits

- **Spinal Articulation**: Feel each vertebra move independently
- **Hamstring Stretch**: Gentle stretch for back of legs
- **Decompression**: Creates space between vertebrae
- **Body Awareness**: Teaches you to feel your spine

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Bending from hips only** - Roll through each vertebra
2. **Locked knees** - Keep them soft throughout
3. **Rushing** - Take your time, especially coming up
4. **Holding breath** - Exhale going down, inhale coming up

## Tips for Success

- Imagine you're peeling your spine off an imaginary wall behind you
- Let gravity help you on the way down
- The slower you go, the more you feel
