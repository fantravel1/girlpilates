Prone Heel Beats target the glutes and inner thighs through rapid, small heel beats. The turned-out leg position emphasizes the inner thigh muscles.

## Beat Your Way to Strength

The quick beating motion creates a different stimulus than slow, controlled exercises, building muscular endurance and coordination.

## Benefits

- **Glute Engagement**: Lifting legs activates glutes
- **Inner Thigh Work**: Turned-out position targets adductors
- **Endurance**: Quick beats build muscular stamina
- **Coordination**: Requires control and rhythm

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Lifting too high** - Small lift is sufficient
2. **Back arching** - Engage core to protect spine
3. **Big beats** - Keep movements small and quick
4. **Tensing shoulders** - Keep upper body relaxed

## Tips for Success

- Think of your heels as magnets clicking together
- Keep your legs turned out from the hips
- Breathe naturally throughout the beats
