Side Lying Clam Circle adds extra challenge to the traditional clamshell through continuous circular movement.

## Open and Circle

The circling motion at the top of the movement creates prolonged glute activation.

## Benefits

- **Extended Glute Work**: Circles maintain tension
- **Hip Stability**: Challenges stabilizers
- **Outer Hip Focus**: Targets glute medius
- **Variation**: Adds interest to basic exercise

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rolling backward** - Keep hips stacked
2. **Circles too big** - Keep them small
3. **Losing position** - Stay stable while circling
4. **Rushing** - Move with control

## Tips for Success

- Keep feet together throughout
- Focus on the outer hip doing the work
- Maintain steady breathing
