Side Kick Grande Ronde borrows from ballet to create a sweeping circular leg movement that challenges hip mobility and stability.

## Sweep Like a Dancer

This ballet-inspired movement creates a beautiful flowing circle with the leg while demanding core stability.

## Benefits

- **Hip Mobility**: Full range of motion in all directions
- **Stability Challenge**: Core must work to prevent rolling
- **Grace**: Develops elegant, controlled movement
- **Hip Strength**: Works all hip muscles

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rolling back** - Keep hips stacked throughout
2. **Rushing** - Move with controlled grace
3. **Circle too small** - Use full range of hip mobility
4. **Forgetting to breathe** - Breathe with the movement

## Tips for Success

- Think of drawing a large circle on the wall
- Keep the movement smooth and continuous
- Engage your core throughout the entire circle
