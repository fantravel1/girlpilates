Arm Springs adapts the Cadillac arm spring exercise for mat practice using a resistance band. This exercise builds upper body strength and control.

## Upper Body Strength

This exercise works the arms, chest, and back through a pressing motion against resistance.

## Benefits

- **Arm Strength**: Builds biceps and triceps
- **Chest Work**: Engages pectorals
- **Back Engagement**: Works lats on the press
- **Control**: Develops eccentric strength on return

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Arching back** - Keep back flat on mat
2. **Rushing** - Control both directions
3. **Locking elbows** - Keep slight bend
4. **Shrugging shoulders** - Keep shoulders down

## Tips for Success

- Keep your core engaged throughout
- Control the return phase - don't let the band snap back
- Focus on your breath - exhale on the press
