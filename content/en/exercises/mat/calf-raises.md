Calf Raises strengthen the lower leg muscles and improve ankle stability for better balance.

## Rise Up Strong

This simple exercise builds the calf muscles that are essential for walking, running, and balance.

## Benefits

- **Calf Strength**: Builds gastrocnemius and soleus
- **Ankle Stability**: Improves joint stability
- **Balance**: Challenges equilibrium at top
- **Functional**: Supports all weight-bearing activities

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rolling out** - Keep weight centered over toes
2. **Rushing** - Move with control, especially lowering
3. **Not going high enough** - Rise fully onto toes
4. **Forgetting to breathe** - Breathe naturally

## Tips for Success

- Imagine pressing through all five toes equally
- Lower slowly to maximize the exercise
- Keep your core engaged for balance
