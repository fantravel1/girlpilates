Calf Stretch targets the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles in the lower leg. These muscles often become tight from wearing heels, walking, and running.

## Don't Forget Your Calves

Calf tightness can contribute to foot, ankle, and knee problems. Regular stretching keeps these muscles flexible and healthy.

## Benefits

- **Calf Flexibility**: Lengthens gastrocnemius and soleus
- **Ankle Mobility**: Improves ankle dorsiflexion
- **Achilles Health**: Maintains tendon flexibility
- **Injury Prevention**: Flexible calves reduce injury risk

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Heel lifting** - Keep heel firmly on ground
2. **Toes turning out** - Keep foot pointing straight ahead
3. **Bouncing** - Hold steady stretch
4. **Rushing** - Hold long enough to feel release

## Tips for Success

- Keep your back leg completely straight for gastrocnemius
- Slightly bend back knee to target soleus
- Maintain good posture throughout the stretch
