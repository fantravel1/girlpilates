Hamstring Stretch is a fundamental stretch for the back of the thigh. Using a strap allows you to control the intensity while keeping proper alignment.

## Release Tight Hamstrings

Tight hamstrings are extremely common and can contribute to lower back pain and poor posture. Regular stretching helps maintain flexibility.

## Benefits

- **Hamstring Flexibility**: Lengthens the back of the thigh
- **Lower Back Relief**: Tight hamstrings pull on the pelvis
- **Improved Posture**: Flexible hamstrings support better alignment
- **Injury Prevention**: Flexible muscles are less prone to injury

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forcing the stretch** - Go to comfortable tension, not pain
2. **Rounding back** - Keep lower back flat on mat
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe deeply throughout
4. **Lifting head** - Keep head relaxed on mat

## Tips for Success

- Let each exhale help you sink deeper into the stretch
- Keep both hip bones level on the mat
- Consistency matters more than intensity
