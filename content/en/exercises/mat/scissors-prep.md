Scissors Prep builds the core strength and control needed for the full Scissors exercise. It teaches you to move your legs independently while maintaining spinal stability.

## Build Your Foundation

This prep version allows you to develop the strength and technique needed before adding the upper body component.

## Benefits

- **Core Stability**: Maintains flat back during leg movement
- **Hip Flexor Strength**: Works hip flexors through full range
- **Control**: Develops independent leg control
- **Preparation**: Builds toward full Scissors exercise

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Back arching** - Keep lower back pressed down
2. **Rushing** - Slow, controlled leg switches
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe rhythmically
4. **Tensing shoulders** - Keep upper body relaxed

## Tips for Success

- Focus on keeping your pelvis stable as legs move
- Only lower legs as far as you can with good form
- Think of legs like scissors - smooth, controlled movement
