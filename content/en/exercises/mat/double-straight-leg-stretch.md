Double Straight Leg Stretch is part of the classical Ab Series of Five, challenging the lower abdominals with straight leg lowers.

## Lower with Control

This exercise tests the ability to maintain a chest lift while the weight of straight legs lowers toward the floor.

## Benefits

- **Lower Ab Focus**: Intense work for lower abdominals
- **Core Endurance**: Maintains lift throughout
- **Hip Flexor Strength**: Controls leg weight
- **Ab Series Integration**: Part of classical sequence

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Back arching** - Keep lower back pressed down
2. **Neck strain** - Support head, don't pull on neck
3. **Legs too low** - Quality over range
4. **Holding breath** - Exhale as you lower

## Tips for Success

- Press your lower back into the mat throughout
- Only lower legs as far as you can control
- Keep elbows wide and chest open
