Boomerang Prep develops the rolling and balancing skills needed for the classical Boomerang exercise. This preparation teaches the sequence in manageable steps.

## Roll and Balance

This exercise combines rolling back with a balance at the top, building control and coordination for the more complex full version.

## Benefits

- **Rolling Skills**: Develops smooth spinal articulation
- **Balance**: Challenges seated balance
- **Core Strength**: Requires deep abdominal engagement
- **Coordination**: Sequences multiple movements

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using momentum** - Roll with control, not speed
2. **Forgetting to switch** - Switch ankles at the top
3. **Falling back** - Control the descent
4. **Tensing neck** - Keep neck relaxed

## Tips for Success

- Use your exhale to initiate the roll back
- Keep your movements smooth and controlled
- Find your balance point before lowering
