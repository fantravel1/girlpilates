faq:
  - q: "Should my elbow touch my knee?"
    a: "Don't force it - focus on rotating your ribcage toward your thigh instead. The twist comes from your waist, not from pulling your elbow."
  - q: "My neck hurts. What am I doing wrong?"
    a: "Support your head's weight in your hands, but don't pull on your neck. The lift should come from your abs."
  - q: "How slow should I go?"
    a: "Slower is better. Hold each rotation for a breath to really feel your obliques working."

Criss Cross is the fifth and final exercise in the "Series of Five." It targets the obliques - the muscles that define your waist and help you rotate.

## The Oblique Burner

If you want a defined waist, Criss Cross is your exercise. The rotation combined with the leg extension creates an intense challenge for your oblique muscles.

## Benefits

- **Oblique Strength**: Primary target for these rotational muscles
- **Waist Definition**: Creates the appearance of a smaller waist
- **Rotational Power**: Builds functional twisting strength
- **Core Endurance**: The continuous movement builds stamina

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Pulling on the neck** - Hands support, abs lift
2. **Racing through** - Quality rotation over quantity
3. **Dropping the extended leg** - Keep it at 45 degrees
4. **Rotating only shoulders** - Turn from the ribcage

## Tips for Success

- Imagine your shoulder blade lifting toward the opposite hip
- Keep your lower back pressed into the mat
- The twist happens in your trunk, not your arms
