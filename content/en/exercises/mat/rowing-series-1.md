Rowing Series 1 is a classical Pilates exercise that strengthens the upper back while challenging seated posture.

## Row for Posture

This exercise counteracts forward-rounded postures by strengthening the muscles that pull shoulders back.

## Benefits

- **Upper Back Strength**: Works rhomboids and mid-traps
- **Posture Improvement**: Opens chest and shoulders
- **Arm Tone**: Engages biceps and shoulders
- **Core Challenge**: Maintains tall seated position

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rounding back** - Stay tall throughout
2. **Shrugging shoulders** - Keep shoulders down
3. **Rushing** - Move with control
4. **Shallow pulling** - Squeeze shoulder blades fully

## Tips for Success

- Think of drawing elbows toward back wall
- Keep chest proud throughout the movement
- Coordinate breath with the rowing motion
