Hip Flexor Stretch targets the psoas and other hip flexor muscles that become tight from sitting. It's essential for maintaining hip mobility and preventing lower back pain.

## Release Tight Hip Flexors

Tight hip flexors are extremely common and can contribute to lower back pain and poor posture. This stretch helps counteract the effects of prolonged sitting.

## Benefits

- **Hip Flexor Length**: Stretches the psoas and iliacus
- **Posture Improvement**: Helps correct anterior pelvic tilt
- **Lower Back Relief**: Releasing hip flexors can ease back tension
- **Hip Mobility**: Improves overall hip range of motion

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Knee past ankle** - Front knee should be directly over ankle
2. **Leaning forward** - Keep torso upright
3. **Pelvis not tucked** - Tuck slightly for maximum stretch
4. **Rushing** - Hold long enough for muscles to release

## Tips for Success

- Think of lengthening your spine toward the ceiling
- Squeeze the glute of your back leg slightly
- Breathe deeply and relax into the stretch
