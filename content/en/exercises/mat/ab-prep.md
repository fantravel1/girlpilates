Ab Prep is the foundation for all abdominal work in Pilates. It teaches proper core engagement and the mechanics of spinal flexion before progressing to more challenging exercises.

## The Building Block

This exercise may seem simple, but mastering proper form here sets you up for success in all other ab exercises.

## Benefits

- **Core Activation**: Learn to engage deep abdominals
- **Proper Form**: Establish correct mechanics for crunching movements
- **Neck Protection**: Train abs to work without neck strain
- **Mind-Body Connection**: Focus on the muscles doing the work

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Pulling on neck** - Hands support, don't pull
2. **Using momentum** - Slow, controlled movements
3. **Holding breath** - Exhale as you curl up
4. **Flattening lower back** - Maintain natural spine curve

## Tips for Success

- Imagine drawing your ribs toward your hips as you curl
- Keep your elbows in peripheral vision (don't let them close in)
- Think of lifting your chest toward the ceiling, not toward your knees
