Standing Hip Circle mobilizes the hip joint through its full range of motion in a weight-bearing position.

## Circle and Balance

This exercise combines hip mobility with single-leg balance challenge.

## Benefits

- **Hip Mobility**: Moves joint through range
- **Balance Challenge**: Single leg stance
- **Warm Up**: Prepares hips for movement
- **Joint Health**: Lubricates hip joint

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Moving from knee** - Circle from hip joint
2. **Circles too big** - Stay in comfortable range
3. **Tensing shoulders** - Stay relaxed
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe naturally

## Tips for Success

- Focus on the hip joint initiating movement
- Keep standing leg slightly bent
- Use support until balance improves
