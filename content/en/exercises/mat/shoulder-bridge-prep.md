Shoulder Bridge Prep builds the foundation for more challenging bridge variations. It strengthens the glutes and teaches proper hip extension alignment.

## Build Your Bridge Foundation

This exercise teaches you to lift the hips using the glutes rather than the lower back, an essential skill for many Pilates exercises.

## Benefits

- **Glute Strength**: Primary muscle worked is the gluteus maximus
- **Hip Extension**: Improves range of hip extension
- **Core Stability**: Requires core engagement throughout
- **Foundation**: Prepares for full Shoulder Bridge

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Overarching back** - Keep ribs connected to hips
2. **Pushing through toes** - Press through heels
3. **Knees falling in** - Keep knees over ankles
4. **Holding breath** - Exhale on the lift

## Tips for Success

- Squeeze your glutes to initiate the lift
- Think of lengthening your spine as you lift
- Keep your weight even between both feet
