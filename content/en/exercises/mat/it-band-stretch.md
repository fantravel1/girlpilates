IT Band Stretch targets the iliotibial band and the muscles surrounding it. The IT band runs along the outer thigh and often becomes tight from running, cycling, or sitting.

## Release Outer Thigh Tension

A tight IT band can contribute to knee pain and hip issues. Regular stretching helps maintain flexibility in this important structure.

## Benefits

- **IT Band Release**: Stretches the outer thigh
- **Hip Opening**: Opens the outer hip
- **Knee Health**: Can help prevent IT band syndrome
- **Low Back Relief**: Often releases associated back tension

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Shoulder lifting** - Keep both shoulders grounded
2. **Forcing the stretch** - Let gravity work
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe deeply throughout
4. **Rushing** - Hold long enough for release

## Tips for Success

- Let your breath help you release deeper
- Keep the stretch comfortable, never painful
- Consistency matters more than intensity
