Seated Spinal Rotation improves thoracic spine mobility - the rotation that occurs in your mid and upper back. Many people lose this mobility from sitting and forward-focused activities.

## Restore Your Twist

Thoracic rotation is essential for daily activities and athletic movements. This exercise helps maintain and improve your ability to rotate.

## Benefits

- **Thoracic Mobility**: Improves mid-back rotation
- **Spinal Health**: Maintains healthy spinal movement
- **Posture Support**: Counteracts forward-hunched position
- **Core Engagement**: Rotation requires oblique activation

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Hips rotating** - Keep pelvis stable
2. **Leaning to one side** - Stay centered
3. **Shoulders rounding** - Maintain open chest
4. **Rushing** - Move with control and breath

## Tips for Success

- Grow taller through your spine before each twist
- Think of wringing out your spine like a towel
- Keep your gaze following your rotation
