Inner Thigh Squeeze is a simple but effective exercise for strengthening the adductors and supporting pelvic floor health.

## Squeeze to Strengthen

This accessible exercise targets the often-neglected inner thigh muscles through an isometric contraction.

## Benefits

- **Inner Thigh Strength**: Works adductor muscles
- **Pelvic Floor Support**: Often engages pelvic floor
- **Easy to Do**: Simple movement for all levels
- **Versatile**: Can be done anywhere

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Holding breath** - Breathe normally during squeeze
2. **Tensing shoulders** - Keep upper body relaxed
3. **Too hard too fast** - Build intensity gradually
4. **Forgetting to release** - Control the release too

## Tips for Success

- Focus on using just your inner thighs
- Keep the rest of your body relaxed
- Try different objects to find what works best
