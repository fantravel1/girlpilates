Hollow Body Hold is a foundational gymnastic exercise that builds tremendous core strength through isometric contraction.

## Curve and Hold

This challenging position creates full core activation with no movement required.

## Benefits

- **Deep Core Activation**: Engages entire abdominal wall
- **Anti-Extension Strength**: Prevents back arching
- **Body Awareness**: Teaches optimal alignment
- **Foundation Building**: Essential for advanced movements

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Back arching** - Must maintain back pressed down
2. **Holding breath** - Breathe shallowly but consistently
3. **Neck straining** - Keep head in line with spine
4. **Going too long** - Better short with good form

## Tips for Success

- Start with easier modifications
- Focus on lower back connection to mat
- Build time gradually
