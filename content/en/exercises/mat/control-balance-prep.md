Control Balance Prep develops the stability and leg control needed for the classical Control Balance exercise. This preparation teaches the inverted position and scissor motion.

## Balanced and Controlled

This exercise challenges you to maintain shoulder stand alignment while moving one leg at a time, building strength and control.

## Benefits

- **Core Stability**: Maintains inverted position
- **Hamstring Control**: Lowers and lifts legs with precision
- **Shoulder Strength**: Supports body weight
- **Balance**: Challenges equilibrium inverted

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rolling onto neck** - Keep weight on shoulders
2. **Rushing leg switch** - Move with control
3. **Losing alignment** - Keep hips stacked over shoulders
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe throughout

## Tips for Success

- Press your elbows firmly into the floor
- Keep your core engaged to support your spine
- Move your legs slowly and with intention
