Scissor Kicks work the lower abdominals through controlled alternating leg movements in a crossing pattern.

## Cross and Control

This classic exercise requires core stability while legs move in opposition.

## Benefits

- **Lower Ab Strength**: Targets difficult-to-reach muscles
- **Hip Flexor Work**: Continuous leg lifting
- **Core Stability**: Maintains spine position
- **Coordination**: Alternating leg pattern

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Back arching** - Maintain neutral spine
2. **Using momentum** - Control the switch
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe steadily
4. **Tensing neck** - Keep upper body relaxed

## Tips for Success

- Start with legs higher and progress lower
- Focus on smooth, controlled switches
- Keep core engaged throughout
