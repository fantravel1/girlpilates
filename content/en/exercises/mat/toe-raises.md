Toe Raises strengthen the tibialis anterior, the muscle on the front of the shin that is often neglected.

## Lift Your Toes

This simple exercise balances the work done by calf raises and helps prevent shin splints.

## Benefits

- **Shin Strength**: Works tibialis anterior
- **Balance**: Counteracts calf dominance
- **Injury Prevention**: Helps prevent shin splints
- **Easy Access**: Can be done anywhere

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Lifting heels** - Keep heels down
2. **Rushing** - Move with control
3. **Not enough range** - Lift toes as high as possible
4. **Forgetting to breathe** - Breathe naturally

## Tips for Success

- Press your heels firmly into the floor
- Lift as high as you can at the top
- Feel the muscles on the front of your shin working
