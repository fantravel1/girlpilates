Leg Circles Prone adds circular movement to prone leg lifts for increased glute challenge and hip mobility.

## Circle and Stabilize

This exercise works the glutes while also challenging hip stability and control.

## Benefits

- **Glute Activation**: Targets multiple glute muscles
- **Hip Mobility**: Circles move through range of motion
- **Core Stability**: Requires stable pelvis
- **Coordination**: Circular pattern challenges control

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Circles too big** - Keep them controlled
2. **Rocking pelvis** - Keep hips stable
3. **Lifting too high** - Small lift is effective
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe throughout

## Tips for Success

- Keep the circles smooth and even
- Maintain hip stability throughout
- Focus on glute engagement
