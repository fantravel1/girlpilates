Heel Squeeze Prone targets the inner thighs and glutes through an isometric squeezing action. This simple but effective exercise tones the inner thigh while also engaging the glutes.

## Squeeze for Strength

The act of pressing the heels together engages the adductors (inner thigh muscles) while the lifted position targets the glutes and hamstrings.

## Benefits

- **Inner Thigh Toning**: Squeezing engages adductors
- **Glute Activation**: Lifting thighs works the glutes
- **Hamstring Work**: Back of legs engage to lift
- **Low Impact**: Gentle on joints while effective

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Lifting too high** - Just a small lift is needed
2. **Separating heels** - Keep constant connection
3. **Tensing shoulders** - Keep upper body relaxed
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe throughout

## Tips for Success

- Focus on the squeeze, not the height of the lift
- Keep your pubic bone pressing into the mat
- Think of your heels as magnets pulling together
