Standing Leg Circles challenge balance and hip mobility while strengthening the standing leg.

## Circle for Balance

This exercise works hip mobility through circling while challenging single-leg balance.

## Benefits

- **Hip Mobility**: Full range of motion in hip
- **Balance**: Challenges single-leg stability
- **Leg Strength**: Standing leg works hard
- **Coordination**: Circle with precision

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Shifting weight** - Keep weight centered over standing leg
2. **Big circles** - Keep them controlled and small
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe naturally
4. **Locking knee** - Keep standing knee soft

## Tips for Success

- Engage your core to help with balance
- Start with very small circles
- Focus your gaze on a fixed point
