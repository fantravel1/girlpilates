Side Kick Beats is a side-lying exercise that uses small, rapid pulses to fatigue the outer thigh muscles while challenging stability.

## Beat to the Rhythm

This exercise focuses on endurance through small, quick movements rather than large ranges of motion.

## Benefits

- **Outer Thigh Burn**: Quick pulses create muscle fatigue
- **Inner Thigh Work**: Beats engage adductors too
- **Endurance**: Builds muscular stamina
- **Stability**: Core works to keep body still

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Beats too big** - Keep movements small and quick
2. **Leg too high** - Stay at hip height
3. **Body rocking** - Keep torso completely still
4. **Holding breath** - Keep breathing steadily

## Tips for Success

- Think of your leg vibrating rather than swinging
- Engage your core to stay stable
- Focus on speed rather than range
