The Single Leg Stretch is part of the "Series of Five" - a group of ab exercises performed in sequence. It builds coordination, core stability, and hip flexor strength.

## The Pilates Connection

This exercise teaches you to stabilize your center while your limbs move independently - a fundamental Pilates principle.

## Benefits

- **Core Stability**: Maintain a stable trunk while legs move
- **Coordination**: Opposite arm and leg patterns challenge your brain
- **Hip Flexor Strength**: Controlled leg movement builds functional strength
- **Breath Control**: Rhythmic breathing enhances the workout

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rocking the pelvis** - Keep hips absolutely still
2. **Pulling knee too hard** - Gentle guidance, not yanking
3. **Letting shoulders creep up** - Keep them down and relaxed
4. **Holding breath** - Exhale as you switch legs

## Tips for Success

- Think of your torso as a solid plank - nothing moves except arms and legs
- Keep your gaze at your knees to maintain neck alignment
- Imagine you're hugging your knee to your chest with control
