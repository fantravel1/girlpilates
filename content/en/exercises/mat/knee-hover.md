Knee Hover is a deceptively challenging isometric exercise that fires up the entire core. The small movement of lifting knees just slightly off the mat creates intense core engagement.

## Small Movement, Big Challenge

Don't be fooled by the minimal movement - this exercise requires significant core strength to maintain proper position.

## Benefits

- **Deep Core Activation**: Engages transverse abdominis
- **Core Endurance**: Isometric holds build stamina
- **Shoulder Stability**: Strengthens shoulder girdle
- **Full Body Integration**: Connects arms, core, and legs

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Lifting knees too high** - Keep them just 1-2 inches up
2. **Holding breath** - Breathe steadily throughout
3. **Sinking into shoulders** - Push floor away, create length
4. **Rounding or arching back** - Maintain flat, neutral spine

## Tips for Success

- Think of pulling your belly button toward your spine
- Keep your neck long, gaze between your hands
- Start with shorter holds and build up
