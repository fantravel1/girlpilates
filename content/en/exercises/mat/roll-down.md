The Roll Down is a foundational Pilates exercise that teaches spinal articulation while stretching the back body. It's an excellent way to start or end any workout.

## Articulate Through Your Spine

This exercise develops awareness of each spinal segment as you roll down and up, promoting flexibility and control throughout the back.

## Benefits

- **Spinal Articulation**: Moves through each vertebra
- **Back Stretch**: Lengthens entire posterior chain
- **Hamstring Flexibility**: Gentle stretch for back of legs
- **Mind-Body Connection**: Develops spinal awareness

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Folding at hips** - Roll through spine, don't hinge
2. **Locking knees** - Keep soft bend in knees
3. **Rushing** - Move slowly to feel each vertebra
4. **Holding tension** - Let head and arms hang heavy

## Tips for Success

- Imagine peeling your spine off an imaginary wall
- Let gravity help you descend
- Use your core to control the movement, especially rolling up
