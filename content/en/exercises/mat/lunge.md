The Lunge is a fundamental lower body exercise that builds leg strength and improves balance and coordination.

## Step and Lower

This exercise works each leg individually, helping to correct imbalances and build functional strength.

## Benefits

- **Leg Strength**: Works quads, glutes, and hamstrings
- **Balance**: Challenges stability in split stance
- **Unilateral**: Addresses left-right imbalances
- **Functional**: Mimics walking and stair climbing

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Knee past toes** - Step far enough for knee over ankle
2. **Leaning forward** - Keep torso upright
3. **Narrow stance** - Keep feet hip-width for balance
4. **Rushing** - Move with control

## Tips for Success

- Think of lowering straight down, not forward
- Keep your weight distributed between both feet
- Engage your core for stability
