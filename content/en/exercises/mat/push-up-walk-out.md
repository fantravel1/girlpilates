The Push Up Walk Out combines spinal articulation with full body strength work. This functional exercise transitions from standing to plank and back, building core control throughout.

## Full Body Flow

This exercise works the entire body through a flowing sequence that develops strength, flexibility, and coordination.

## Benefits

- **Full Body Work**: Engages multiple muscle groups
- **Spinal Articulation**: Rolls through spine each direction
- **Core Stability**: Maintains plank position
- **Functional Movement**: Standing to floor transition

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rushing the roll** - Articulate through each vertebra
2. **Sagging in plank** - Keep core engaged
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe through movement
4. **Skipping the walk** - Don't jump hands forward

## Tips for Success

- Roll down slowly, feeling each vertebra
- Keep your core engaged during the walk out
- Walk hands in line with shoulders
