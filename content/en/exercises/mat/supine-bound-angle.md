Supine Bound Angle is a restorative hip opener that allows the inner thighs and hips to release through passive stretching.

## Open and Relax

This gentle position uses gravity to slowly open the hips without active effort.

## Benefits

- **Hip Opening**: Passive stretch for hips
- **Inner Thigh Release**: Stretches adductors
- **Restorative**: Deeply relaxing position
- **Breathing**: Opens front body for breath

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forcing knees down** - Let gravity do the work
2. **Not supporting knees** - Use props if needed
3. **Short holds** - Stay long enough to release
4. **Tensing body** - Completely relax

## Tips for Success

- Support your knees if there's any strain
- Place one hand on heart, one on belly for connection
- Breathe slowly and deeply throughout
