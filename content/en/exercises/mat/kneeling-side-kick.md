The Kneeling Side Kick challenges lateral stability while building hip strength through full range of motion. This exercise requires balance and core control in a unique kneeling position.

## Lateral Challenge

This exercise works the body in the frontal plane while challenging balance and coordination from an unstable kneeling base.

## Benefits

- **Lateral Stability**: Strengthens obliques and hip stabilizers
- **Hip Mobility**: Moves hip through flexion and extension
- **Balance**: Challenges equilibrium in kneeling
- **Full Body**: Engages multiple muscle groups

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Collapsing torso** - Stay lifted through the spine
2. **Shifting hips** - Keep hips stacked and stable
3. **Rushing kicks** - Control the movement both ways
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe with the movement

## Tips for Success

- Press your supporting hand firmly into the floor
- Imagine your torso is a solid pillar
- Use your exhale to power the kick forward
