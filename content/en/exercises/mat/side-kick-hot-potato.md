Side Kick Hot Potato is a dynamic side-lying exercise that challenges hip stability while building endurance in the legs.

## Quick Like a Hot Potato

The quick tapping motion adds a cardio element to traditional side kick work while challenging hip stability.

## Benefits

- **Hip Stability**: Core must stabilize while leg moves
- **Leg Endurance**: Quick movements build stamina
- **Coordination**: Front to back pattern challenges brain
- **Fun Factor**: Playful variation of side kicks

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rocking torso** - Keep body still, move only the leg
2. **Leg too high** - Keep at hip height
3. **Losing alignment** - Stack hips throughout
4. **Forgetting to breathe** - Keep breathing steady

## Tips for Success

- Think of your torso as completely still
- Move just the leg like it's separate from your body
- Keep the tapping light and quick
