Arm Circles are a simple but effective exercise for warming up and mobilizing the shoulder joints. They can be done standing, seated, or lying down.

## Shoulder Health Made Simple

Regular arm circles help maintain shoulder mobility and can help prevent stiffness and injury.

## Benefits

- **Shoulder Mobility**: Improves range of motion
- **Joint Warm-Up**: Perfect for preparing shoulders for exercise
- **Circulation**: Increases blood flow to shoulder area
- **Tension Release**: Helps release shoulder tension

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Moving too fast** - Keep movements controlled
2. **Shrugging shoulders** - Keep shoulders down
3. **Locking elbows** - Maintain soft elbows
4. **Forgetting to breathe** - Breathe naturally

## Tips for Success

- Keep your core engaged for stability
- Imagine drawing perfect circles in the air
- Both directions are equally important
