Neck Pull Prep develops the spinal articulation and core strength needed for the full Neck Pull exercise. This challenging movement requires significant abdominal control.

## Articulate and Control

This exercise teaches you to roll up and down through your spine while keeping hands behind your head, building strength for the classical exercise.

## Benefits

- **Spinal Articulation**: Moves through each vertebra
- **Core Strength**: Deep abdominal engagement
- **Flexibility**: Stretches spine and hamstrings
- **Control**: Develops slow, controlled movement

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using momentum** - Roll with control
2. **Pulling on neck** - Support head, don't pull
3. **Rushing** - Move slowly and deliberately
4. **Flat back on way up** - Keep spine rounded

## Tips for Success

- Think of peeling your spine off the mat
- Keep elbows wide throughout
- Use your exhale to power the movement
