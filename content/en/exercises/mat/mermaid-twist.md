Mermaid Twist combines the beautiful side stretch of the Mermaid with added spinal rotation, creating a comprehensive stretch for the entire side body and back.

## Side Stretch Meets Twist

The combination of lateral flexion and rotation addresses multiple planes of movement, making this a highly effective stretch.

## Benefits

- **Oblique Stretch**: Deep stretch for the side body
- **Spinal Mobility**: Combines flexion with rotation
- **Rib Expansion**: Opens the ribcage for better breathing
- **Back Relief**: Releases tension through the back

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forcing the rotation** - Let it develop naturally
2. **Collapsing** - Maintain length as you twist
3. **Holding breath** - Use breath to deepen stretch
4. **Rushing** - Move slowly through each phase

## Tips for Success

- Grow taller before you bend or twist
- Let your breath guide the movement
- Keep both sit bones grounded as much as possible
