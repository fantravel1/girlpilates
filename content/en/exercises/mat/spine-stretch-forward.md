    a: "Focus on the C-curve of your spine, not how far you reach. Quality of movement over range."

The Spine Stretch Forward teaches spinal articulation - the ability to move your spine one vertebra at a time. This fundamental skill appears throughout the Pilates repertoire.

## The Art of Articulation

Unlike touching your toes in a stretch class, this exercise focuses on HOW you move, not how far. Each vertebra peels off the imaginary wall behind you.

## Benefits

- **Spinal Mobility**: Increases flexibility in the entire spine
- **Hamstring Stretch**: Lengthens the back of the legs
- **Core Control**: Requires deep ab engagement to articulate
- **Postural Awareness**: Teaches you to feel each segment of your spine

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Collapsing forward** - Maintain lift even as you round
2. **Locking knees** - Keep a micro-bend if needed
3. **Rounding from lower back only** - Start from the crown of your head
4. **Holding breath** - Exhale to round, inhale to stack

## Tips for Success

- Imagine diving over a beach ball in front of you
- Pull your abs back as your arms reach forward - oppositional energy
- Think of your spine as a string of pearls, moving one pearl at a time
