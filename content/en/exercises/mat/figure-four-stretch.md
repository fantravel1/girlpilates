Figure Four Stretch is one of the most effective stretches for the piriformis and outer hip muscles. It's named for the shape your legs make - like the number 4.

## Deep Hip Relief

This stretch targets muscles that often become tight from sitting, helping relieve tension in the hips and lower back.

## Benefits

- **Piriformis Stretch**: Directly targets the piriformis muscle
- **Hip Opening**: Releases tight outer hip muscles
- **Sciatica Relief**: Can help relieve sciatic nerve tension
- **Low Back Relief**: Relaxing hips often relieves back tension

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Foot not flexed** - Always flex the crossed foot
2. **Forcing the stretch** - Go only to comfortable intensity
3. **Lifting head** - Keep head relaxed on the mat
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe deeply throughout

## Tips for Success

- Let gravity and your breath deepen the stretch naturally
- Keep your tailbone on the mat
- If you can't reach your thigh, use a strap or towel
