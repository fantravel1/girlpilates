Breast Stroke combines back extension with a swimming-like arm movement to target the upper back and posterior shoulders. It's great for posture improvement.

## Swim on Land

This exercise mimics the arm pattern of breast stroke swimming while adding back extension for a comprehensive upper body workout.

## Benefits

- **Upper Back Strength**: Targets the rhomboids and mid-trapezius
- **Posterior Shoulders**: Works the often-neglected back of shoulders
- **Posture Improvement**: Strengthens the muscles that pull shoulders back
- **Spinal Extension**: Mobilizes and strengthens the back

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-arching lower back** - Keep abs engaged
2. **Tensing neck** - Keep neck long, gaze down
3. **Rushing arm circles** - Slow, controlled movement
4. **Forgetting to breathe** - Inhale to lift, exhale to lower

## Tips for Success

- Think of reaching long through your fingertips
- The lift comes from your upper back, not by crunching lower back
- Keep your legs and feet relaxed on the mat
