Side Bend Stretch is a simple way to lengthen the muscles along the side of the body.

## Reach and Bend

This accessible stretch targets the lateral line from hip to armpit.

## Benefits

- **Side Body Release**: Stretches obliques and lats
- **Breathing Space**: Opens intercostals
- **Posture Support**: Balances side muscles
- **Simple to Do**: No equipment needed

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Leaning forward** - Bend directly to side
2. **Collapsing chest** - Stay open
3. **Forcing too far** - Keep stretch gentle
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe into stretched side

## Tips for Success

- Imagine reaching up and over a ball
- Keep both feet (or sit bones) grounded
- Breathe into the stretched side
