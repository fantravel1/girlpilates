Side Kick Bicycle creates a pedaling motion while lying on your side, working the hip through its full range of motion.

## Pedal to Strengthen

This exercise mimics a cycling motion to challenge hip mobility and strength in all directions.

## Benefits

- **Hip Mobility**: Full range of motion in hip joint
- **Muscle Balance**: Works all thigh muscles equally
- **Coordination**: Complex movement pattern
- **Core Stability**: Must stabilize while leg moves

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rolling back** - Keep hips stacked throughout
2. **Moving too fast** - Control each phase of the circle
3. **Shortening range** - Use full pedaling motion
4. **Tensing upper body** - Keep relaxed above the waist

## Tips for Success

- Imagine you're actually pedaling a bicycle
- Keep the movement smooth and continuous
- Don't forget to reverse direction
