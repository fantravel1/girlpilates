Bent Knee Fallouts teach pelvic stability in a different plane of motion. As the knee opens to the side, the core must work to prevent the pelvis from rotating.

## Stabilize Against Rotation

This exercise trains your deep core to resist rotation, an important skill for protecting the spine during daily activities.

## Benefits

- **Pelvic Stability**: Maintains neutral during hip rotation
- **Hip Mobility**: Opens the hip in external rotation
- **Inner Thigh Stretch**: Gently stretches adductors
- **Core Control**: Anti-rotation challenge for core

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Pelvis tilting** - Keep pelvis absolutely stable
2. **Opening too far** - Range is limited by stability
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe naturally throughout
4. **Rushing** - Move slowly to feel the control

## Tips for Success

- Imagine your pelvis is glued to the mat
- The movement happens only in the hip socket
- Start with smaller range and progress as control improves
