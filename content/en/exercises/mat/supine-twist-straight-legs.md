Supine Twist Straight Legs is an advanced variation that deepens the spinal rotation and adds a hamstring stretch.

## Twist with Length

This challenging position combines rotation with leg extension for a comprehensive stretch.

## Benefits

- **Deep Rotation**: More intense spinal twist
- **Hamstring Stretch**: Adds leg lengthening
- **Oblique Work**: Challenges abdominals
- **Core Control**: Requires control to lower legs

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forcing range** - Go only as far as comfortable
2. **Lifting shoulder** - Keep both as grounded as possible
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe throughout
4. **Legs too heavy** - Control the descent

## Tips for Success

- Use your core to control the movement
- Keep reaching through your heels
- Breathe into the twist to deepen it
