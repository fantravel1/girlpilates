Scooter is a functional standing exercise that challenges balance while building glute strength. The scooting motion mimics real-life movements like climbing stairs.

## Balance and Strength Combined

This exercise works your standing leg for stability while the moving leg builds strength through hip extension.

## Benefits

- **Glute Strength**: Hip extension targets the glutes
- **Balance**: Single-leg stance challenges stability
- **Functional**: Translates to everyday movements
- **Coordination**: Requires full-body coordination

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Arching back** - Keep spine neutral
2. **Swinging leg** - Controlled movements only
3. **Leaning forward** - Stay upright
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe naturally

## Tips for Success

- Engage your core throughout for stability
- Push through your glute, not your lower back
- Start with support and progress to freestanding
