Lower Lift is a fundamental core exercise that challenges the lower abdominals to maintain stability while the legs move.

## Control the Lower

This exercise teaches core control by lowering heavy leg weight while keeping the spine stable.

## Benefits

- **Lower Ab Strength**: Targets low abdominals
- **Spinal Stability**: Maintains neutral spine
- **Core Control**: Develops precision
- **Hip Flexor Work**: Strengthens hip flexors

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Back arching** - Keep lower back pressed down
2. **Going too low** - Quality over depth
3. **Holding breath** - Exhale as you lower
4. **Rushing** - Move slowly and controlled

## Tips for Success

- Press your lower back firmly into the mat
- Only lower to where you maintain control
- Think of your abs pulling legs back up
