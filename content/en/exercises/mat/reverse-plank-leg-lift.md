Reverse Plank Leg Lift combines the posterior chain challenge of reverse plank with dynamic leg movement.

## Lift and Hold

This advanced exercise works the entire backside of the body while challenging balance.

## Benefits

- **Posterior Chain**: Works glutes, hamstrings, back
- **Shoulder Stability**: Arms support body weight
- **Core Challenge**: Maintaining position while moving
- **Hip Extension**: Lifting legs engages glutes

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Hips sagging** - Keep hips lifted throughout
2. **Locking elbows** - Keep slight bend
3. **Neck tension** - Keep head neutral
4. **Rushing** - Control each lift

## Tips for Success

- Master reverse plank hold first
- Lift leg only as high as hips stay up
- Squeeze glutes throughout
