Standing Knee Lift is a simple but effective exercise for strengthening hip flexors and improving balance.

## Lift for Stability

This functional movement mimics the action of walking and climbing, building practical strength.

## Benefits

- **Hip Flexor Strength**: Works muscles that lift the leg
- **Balance**: Challenges single-leg stability
- **Core Engagement**: Stabilizes during movement
- **Functional**: Supports walking and stair climbing

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Leaning back** - Stay tall as you lift
2. **Dropping chest** - Keep chest proud
3. **Rushing** - Move with control
4. **Forgetting to breathe** - Breathe naturally

## Tips for Success

- Think of pulling your knee up with your core
- Keep your standing leg strong and stable
- Focus your gaze on a fixed point
