Knee to Elbow Plank adds dynamic hip flexion to the plank position for increased core challenge.

## Draw and Return

This exercise combines plank stability with hip and core activation.

## Benefits

- **Core Challenge**: Maintains plank while moving
- **Oblique Activation**: Especially cross-body variation
- **Hip Flexor Work**: Drawing knee engages hip flexors
- **Shoulder Stability**: Supports body throughout

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Hips rising** - Keep body in line
2. **Rushing** - Control the movement
3. **Collapsing shoulders** - Stay strong in upper body
4. **Forgetting to breathe** - Exhale as knee comes in

## Tips for Success

- Think of crunching your ribs toward your hip
- Keep shoulders over wrists
- Move with control
