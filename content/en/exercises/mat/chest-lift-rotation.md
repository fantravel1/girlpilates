Chest Lift with Rotation adds an oblique-targeting twist to the basic chest lift. The rotation engages the muscles at the sides of your waist.

## Target Your Obliques

While the basic chest lift works the rectus abdominis, adding rotation recruits the obliques for more comprehensive core work.

## Benefits

- **Oblique Strength**: Rotation targets the side muscles
- **Core Integration**: Combines flexion with rotation
- **Waist Definition**: Builds the muscles that define your waist
- **Functional**: Rotational strength for daily activities

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Pulling on neck** - Hands support, don't pull
2. **Leading with elbow** - Rotate from ribs, not elbow
3. **Losing the lift** - Stay curled up throughout
4. **Rushing** - Move with control

## Tips for Success

- Think of bringing your ribcage toward your opposite hip
- Keep both hips anchored to the mat
- Maintain the basic chest lift height as you rotate
