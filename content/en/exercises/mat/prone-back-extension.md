Prone Back Extension is a gentle but effective exercise for building strength in the back extensors. It's a foundational exercise for developing spinal strength.

## Strengthen Your Back

This exercise targets the muscles that run along your spine, helping to support good posture and prevent back pain.

## Benefits

- **Back Strength**: Builds erector spinae muscles
- **Posture Support**: Strengthens muscles that maintain upright posture
- **Spine Health**: Gentle strengthening promotes spinal health
- **Counter Sitting**: Reverses the effects of forward flexion

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Lifting too high** - Keep lift small and controlled
2. **Looking up** - Keep neck in neutral position
3. **Forgetting to engage core** - Abs help protect lower back
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe naturally

## Tips for Success

- Think of lengthening your spine as you lift
- Keep shoulders away from ears
- The movement is small - quality over height
