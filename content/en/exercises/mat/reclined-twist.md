Reclined Twist is a relaxing stretch that gently rotates the spine while releasing tension in the lower back.

## Twist and Release

This calming stretch is perfect for the end of a workout or anytime you need to release spinal tension.

## Benefits

- **Spinal Mobility**: Gently rotates spine
- **Lower Back Relief**: Releases lumbar tension
- **Relaxation**: Calming, restorative position
- **Digestion**: May help with digestive function

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forcing depth** - Go only as far as comfortable
2. **Lifting shoulder** - Keep shoulder as close to floor as possible
3. **Rushing** - Take time to relax into position
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe deeply

## Tips for Success

- Let gravity do the work - don't force
- Breathe deeply and let muscles release
- Keep both shoulders reaching toward floor
