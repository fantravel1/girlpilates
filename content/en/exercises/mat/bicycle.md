faq:
  - q: "Is this the same as bicycle crunches?"
    a: "No - Pilates Bicycle focuses on hip mobility and leg extension, not rotating to touch elbow to knee."
  - q: "My hip flexors cramp. What should I do?"
    a: "Raise your legs higher and slow down. The cramping often comes from going too low too fast."
  - q: "Should I do this fast or slow?"
    a: "Slow and controlled. Speed comes later once you have perfect form."

The Pilates Bicycle is not your gym class bicycle crunch. This exercise focuses on hip mobility and controlled leg movement while maintaining core stability.

## Pedal with Purpose

Unlike rushed bicycle crunches, the Pilates version emphasizes smooth, controlled movement through the full range of the hip joint.

## Benefits

- **Hip Mobility**: Full range cycling motion improves hip flexibility
- **Core Strength**: Maintaining stability while legs move
- **Hip Flexor Work**: Controlled extension strengthens the hip flexors
- **Coordination**: Smooth cycling requires mind-body connection

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Going too fast** - Slow, controlled movements only
2. **Lower back arching** - Keep it pressed into mat
3. **Choppy transitions** - Smooth, continuous cycling
4. **Forgetting to reverse** - Work both directions equally

## Tips for Success

- Imagine you're cycling through thick molasses
- Keep your torso completely still as legs move
- The lower your legs go, the harder your core works
