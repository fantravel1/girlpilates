Windmill is a flowing standing exercise that combines rotation, side bending, and hamstring flexibility.

## Rotate and Reach

This full-body movement challenges balance while stretching and strengthening multiple muscle groups.

## Benefits

- **Oblique Strength**: Works side body muscles
- **Hamstring Flexibility**: Stretches back of legs
- **Balance Challenge**: Requires stability
- **Spinal Mobility**: Rotation and side bending

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rounding spine** - Keep length throughout
2. **Locking knees** - Keep slight bend
3. **Collapsing chest** - Stay open and lifted
4. **Moving too fast** - Control the movement

## Tips for Success

- Think of creating a straight line from hand to hand
- Keep your weight evenly distributed
- Move slowly and with control
