Frog Stretch is one of the most effective stretches for opening the hips and targeting the inner thighs. It's named for the frog-like position of the legs.

## Deep Hip Opening

This stretch targets the adductors and hip flexors in a way that few other stretches can match, making it invaluable for hip flexibility.

## Benefits

- **Inner Thigh Stretch**: Deeply stretches adductors
- **Hip Opening**: Opens the hip joints
- **Groin Flexibility**: Increases range in the groin area
- **Lower Back Relief**: Can help release lower back tension

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Going too deep too fast** - Ease into this stretch gradually
2. **Feet not aligned** - Keep ankles in line with knees
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe deeply to help release
4. **Forcing the stretch** - Let gravity do the work

## Tips for Success

- Use padding under your knees for comfort
- Let your body relax into the stretch with each exhale
- This stretch takes time - be patient with your progress
