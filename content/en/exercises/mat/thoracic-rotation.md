Thoracic Rotation mobilizes the mid and upper spine through a gentle rotating motion while lying on the side.

## Open and Rotate

This exercise specifically targets the thoracic spine, which often becomes stiff from sitting.

## Benefits

- **Thoracic Mobility**: Specifically targets mid-spine
- **Chest Opening**: Stretches across chest
- **Posture**: Counteracts forward-rounded posture
- **Breathing**: Opens ribs for better breathing

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rolling hips** - Keep lower body completely still
2. **Rushing** - Move slowly and mindfully
3. **Forcing range** - Go only as far as comfortable
4. **Neck strain** - Keep head supported

## Tips for Success

- Think of rotating from your ribcage, not shoulders
- Keep your eyes following your hand
- Breathe into the stretch at the end range
