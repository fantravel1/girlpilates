Standing Back Leg Lift strengthens the glutes and hamstrings while working on posture and balance.

## Lift Behind

This exercise targets the muscles of the posterior chain that support good posture and walking mechanics.

## Benefits

- **Glute Strength**: Targets gluteus maximus
- **Posture Support**: Works muscles for upright stance
- **Balance**: Challenges single-leg stability
- **Functional**: Supports walking and climbing

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Arching back** - Keep spine neutral, lift from glute
2. **Leaning forward** - Stay tall as you lift
3. **Lifting too high** - Quality over height
4. **Rushing** - Move with control

## Tips for Success

- Squeeze your glute to initiate the lift
- Keep your pelvis facing forward
- Think of lengthening leg behind, not just lifting
