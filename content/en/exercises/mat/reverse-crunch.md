Reverse Crunch targets the lower portion of the abdominals by moving the pelvis toward the ribcage.

## Curl from Below

Unlike traditional crunches that move the upper body, this exercise focuses on lifting from the pelvis.

## Benefits

- **Lower Ab Focus**: Targets lower abdominal muscles
- **Spinal Flexion**: Controlled rounding of lower spine
- **Hip Flexor Balance**: Works in conjunction with hip flexors
- **Back Friendly**: Less neck strain than traditional crunches

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using momentum** - Lift with control, not swing
2. **Lifting too high** - Small controlled movement
3. **Pressing with arms** - Arms support, don't push
4. **Holding breath** - Exhale as you lift

## Tips for Success

- Think of curling your tailbone toward your belly button
- Keep the movement small and controlled
- Focus on the lower abs initiating the movement
