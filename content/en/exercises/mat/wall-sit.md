Wall Sit is an isometric exercise that builds leg endurance by holding a seated position against a wall.

## Sit Against the Wall

This exercise challenges the quads and glutes through sustained muscular contraction without movement.

## Benefits

- **Isometric Strength**: Holds build strength without movement
- **Joint-Friendly**: No impact on joints
- **Mental Challenge**: Tests willpower and focus

2. **Back not flat** - Press entire back into wall
3. **Too low** - Start higher, work down over time
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe normally throughout

## Tips for Success

- Find a comfortable depth to start
- Focus on steady breathing to help endure
