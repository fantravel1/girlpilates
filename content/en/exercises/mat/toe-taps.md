faq:
  - q: "My lower back arches when I lower my leg. What do I do?"
    a: "Don't lower your leg as far. Your range should only be as large as you can maintain a neutral spine."
  - q: "Should my toes actually touch the floor?"
    a: "It depends on your flexibility. The goal is controlled movement, not necessarily floor contact."
  - q: "I feel this more in my hip flexors than abs."
    a: "Focus on keeping your abs scooped. Reduce range of motion to shift the work to your core."

Toe Taps teach a fundamental Pilates skill: maintaining core stability while the legs move. It's deceptively simple but incredibly effective for building deep ab strength.

## The Stability Test

This exercise reveals whether you can truly control your core. If your back arches as your leg lowers, your abs aren't doing their job yet.

## Benefits

- **Core Stability**: Learn to stabilize while limbs move
- **Deep Ab Strength**: Works the transverse abdominis
- **Hip Flexor Control**: Teaches controlled hip movement
- **Foundation Builder**: Prepares you for all leg-lowering exercises

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Back arching** - Reduce range if this happens
2. **Holding breath** - Keep breathing throughout
3. **Rushing** - Slow, controlled taps
4. **Losing tabletop** - Keep knee angle consistent

## Tips for Success

- Think of your pelvis as a bowl of water - don't spill it
- Only lower as far as you can control
- Your abs should feel like a corset tightening as you move
