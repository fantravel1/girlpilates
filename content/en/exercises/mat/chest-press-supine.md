Chest Press Supine builds upper body strength while lying on your back, making it accessible for all levels.

## Press to Strengthen

This exercise targets the chest and shoulders while maintaining a stable spine position.

## Benefits

- **Chest Strength**: Works pectoral muscles
- **Shoulder Stability**: Strengthens deltoids
- **Arm Tone**: Builds triceps strength
- **Core Work**: Maintains stable spine

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Arching back** - Keep spine neutral on mat
2. **Locking elbows** - Keep slight softness at top
3. **Rushing** - Move with control
4. **Wide elbows** - Keep elbows at 45 degrees

## Tips for Success

- Press your lower back into the mat
- Keep your wrists stacked over elbows
- Breathe out as you press up
