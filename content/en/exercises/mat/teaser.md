The Teaser is the crown jewel of Pilates mat work. This challenging exercise combines everything you've learned: core strength, spinal articulation, control, and balance.

## The Ultimate Test

Joseph Pilates called this the "teaser" because it teases your body and mind. Just when you think you have it, you lose balance. It demands full presence.

## Benefits

- **Total Core Engagement**: Every ab muscle fires intensely
- **Hip Flexor Strength**: Essential for the leg hold
- **Spinal Articulation**: Rolling up and down vertebra by vertebra
- **Balance and Control**: Finding stillness in an unstable position

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using momentum** - Roll up with control, not a throw
2. **Holding breath** - Keep breathing throughout
3. **Rounding too much** - Lift chest toward thighs, stay lengthened
4. **Gripping hip flexors** - Let your deep abs do the work

## Tips for Success

- Master Roll Up before attempting Teaser
- Start with the bent knee modification
- Think of your body making a V-shape
- The descent is just as important as the ascent
