Single Leg Glute Bridge challenges each leg independently, building balanced strength and identifying weaknesses.

## One Leg at a Time

This progression from the basic bridge increases the demand on each glute and challenges stability.

## Benefits

- **Unilateral Strength**: Works each side independently
- **Glute Activation**: Intense work for each glute
- **Balance Detection**: Reveals side-to-side differences
- **Core Challenge**: Must stabilize pelvis

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Hips dropping** - Keep pelvis level throughout
2. **Over-arching** - Lift with glutes, not back
3. **Rushing** - Move with control
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe naturally

## Tips for Success

- Press firmly through the standing foot
- Keep your lifted leg actively reaching up
- Focus on keeping hips completely level
