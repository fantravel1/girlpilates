Side Leg Lifts are a simple but effective exercise for targeting the outer hip and glute medius. They're the foundation for all side-lying leg work.

## Simple Yet Powerful

This exercise looks easy but done correctly, it creates significant burn in the outer hip muscles.

## Benefits

- **Outer Hip Strength**: Targets glute medius and minimus
- **Hip Stability**: Builds lateral hip stabilizers
- **Core Engagement**: Maintaining alignment requires core work
- **Injury Prevention**: Strong outer hips prevent knee and hip issues

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Hip rolling back** - Keep hips stacked
2. **Lifting from hip flexor** - Use outer hip
3. **Swinging leg** - Slow, controlled lifts
4. **Body not in line** - Maintain straight alignment

## Tips for Success

- Imagine your body between two panes of glass
- Lead the lift with your heel, not your toe
- Keep energy through the whole leg, not just the hip
