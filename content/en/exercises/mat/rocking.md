Rocking is a beautiful, advanced exercise that mimics a bow position from yoga. The rocking motion massages the organs and creates a wonderful stretch through the entire front body.

## The Human Bow

Your body creates the shape of a bow - your arms are the string, your torso is the arc. The rock comes from the tension between the two.

## Benefits

- **Spinal Extension**: Deep back bend opens the entire front body
- **Quad Stretch**: Legs pulled back stretch the front of thighs
- **Organ Massage**: Rocking massages abdominal organs
- **Shoulder Opening**: Reaching back opens the chest and shoulders

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Collapsing the lift** - Keep pressing feet into hands
2. **Rocking from momentum** - Use breath to guide the rock
3. **Over-compressing lower back** - Think length, not crunch
4. **Holding breath** - Exhale forward, inhale back

## Tips for Success

- Build up to this exercise - master Swan and Double Leg Kick first
- The rock should feel smooth, like a cradle
- Quality over quantity - a few good rocks beats many sloppy ones
