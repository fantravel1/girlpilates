Alternating Superman strengthens the back and glutes while requiring coordination between opposite limbs.

## Lift and Coordinate

This accessible exercise builds posterior strength with alternating movement.

## Benefits

- **Back Strengthening**: Works erector spinae
- **Glute Activation**: Engages glutes on lifting leg
- **Coordination**: Opposite arm/leg pattern
- **Core Stability**: Requires stable trunk

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Lifting too high** - Keep movement controlled
2. **Holding breath** - Breathe throughout
3. **Looking up** - Maintain neutral neck
4. **Rushing** - Move with purpose

## Tips for Success

- Keep core engaged throughout
- Focus on length rather than height
- Move slowly and deliberately
