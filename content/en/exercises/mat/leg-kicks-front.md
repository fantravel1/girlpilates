Leg Kicks Front is a dynamic side-lying exercise that works hip mobility and challenges core stability as the leg swings forward.

## Dynamic Hip Work

The swinging motion with control creates a different challenge than static exercises, building functional hip strength and mobility.

## Benefits

- **Hip Flexor Strength**: Forward kick builds hip flexor power
- **Hamstring Stretch**: Forward position stretches the back of the leg
- **Core Stability**: Torso must stay stable during leg movement
- **Coordination**: Requires timing and control

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Torso rocking** - Keep body completely still
2. **Kicking too high** - Keep leg at hip height
3. **Losing alignment** - Maintain straight body line
4. **Using momentum only** - Control the movement

## Tips for Success

- Keep your waist lifted off the mat slightly
- Think of your leg swinging like a pendulum
- The double pulse at front increases the stretch
