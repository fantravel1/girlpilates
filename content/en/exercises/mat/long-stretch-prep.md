Long Stretch Prep builds the foundation for the classical reformer exercise by developing full body strength and alignment in a static plank hold.

## Full Body Integration

This preparatory exercise teaches you to engage your entire body as one integrated unit, a key skill for Pilates.

## Benefits

- **Core Strength**: Challenges deep stabilizers
- **Shoulder Stability**: Builds shoulder endurance
- **Full Body Awareness**: Integrates all muscle groups
- **Foundation**: Prepares for advanced exercises

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Hips sagging** - Keep body in one straight line
2. **Hips piking** - Don't lift hips too high
3. **Holding breath** - Maintain steady breathing

## Tips for Success

- Think of pushing the floor away from you
