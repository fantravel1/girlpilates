Plank Shoulder Taps challenge your core's anti-rotation ability while maintaining a stable plank.

## Tap and Stabilize

This exercise requires your core to resist rotation as you lift each hand.

## Benefits

- **Anti-Rotation Training**: Resists twisting forces
- **Core Stability**: Maintains plank under challenge
- **Shoulder Strength**: Supports on single arm
- **Coordination**: Alternating pattern

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Hips swaying** - Keep pelvis stable
2. **Moving too fast** - Slow is more effective
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe steadily
4. **Sagging middle** - Keep core engaged

## Tips for Success

- Think of keeping your hips completely still
- Widen feet for more stability
- Move slowly and with control
