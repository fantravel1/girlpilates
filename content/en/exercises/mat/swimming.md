faq:
  - q: "I can barely get off the floor. Is that okay?"
    a: "Yes! Start small. Even lifting a centimeter engages the right muscles. Height comes with strength."

    a: "No - use the 5-count breath pattern like the Hundred. Inhale for 5 flutter beats, exhale for 5."
  - q: "My neck gets tired quickly. What can I do?"
    a: "Look down at the mat rather than forward. You can also do the exercise with forehead on a small towel."

Swimming brings the back body to life. This dynamic exercise mimics the flutter kick of freestyle swimming while building tremendous strength in the posterior chain.

## Full Back Body Activation

Every muscle from your neck to your heels works in Swimming. It's one of the most comprehensive back strengthening exercises in Pilates.

## Benefits

- **Posterior Chain Strength**: Works glutes, hamstrings, and back extensors
- **Coordination**: Opposite arm/leg pattern challenges the brain
- **Endurance**: The flutter builds stamina in the back muscles
- **Counterbalance**: Perfect antidote to sitting all day

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Holding breath** - Maintain rhythmic breathing
2. **Lifting from momentum** - Control each movement
3. **Cranking the neck** - Keep it as an extension of the spine
4. **Tensing shoulders** - Keep them away from ears

## Tips for Success

- Think long, not high - reach fingertips and toes away
- Keep your core engaged to protect the lower back
- The movement should feel buoyant, like you're floating in water
