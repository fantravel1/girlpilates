Hip Drops add dynamic movement to the side plank, creating an intense oblique workout. The lowering and lifting motion targets the waistline effectively.

## Sculpt Your Waist

This exercise is one of the most effective for targeting the obliques and creating definition in the waist area.

## Benefits

- **Oblique Strength**: Primary target is the side body
- **Core Endurance**: Repetitions build stamina
- **Waist Definition**: Sculpts the sides of the waist
- **Shoulder Stability**: Supporting arm works throughout

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Dropping too low** - Controlled dip only
2. **Hips rotating** - Keep hips stacked
3. **Shoulder collapsing** - Push floor away
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe throughout

## Tips for Success

- Keep your body in one plane - no rotating
- Control both the lower and lift phases
- Start with fewer reps and build up
