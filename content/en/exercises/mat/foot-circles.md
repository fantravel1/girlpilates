Foot Circles improve ankle mobility and maintain foot health through gentle circular movements.

## Circle for Mobility

This simple exercise keeps the ankle joints mobile and can be done anywhere, anytime.

## Benefits

- **Ankle Mobility**: Maintains joint flexibility
- **Warm Up**: Great preparation for exercise
- **Foot Health**: Supports overall foot function
- **Easy**: Can be done while sitting

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Moving leg** - Only the foot should move
2. **Too fast** - Move slowly and deliberately
3. **Skipping direction** - Do both clockwise and counter-clockwise
4. **Forgetting one foot** - Always do both feet

## Tips for Success

- Imagine drawing a circle with your big toe
- Make circles as large as possible
- Move smoothly without jerking
