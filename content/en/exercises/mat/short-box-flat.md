Short Box Flat builds back extensor strength through a hinged position with a neutral spine. This complements the rounded variation by training spinal extension control.

## Hinge With Power

This exercise strengthens the muscles that support your spine in extension, building the strength needed for good posture and back health.

## Benefits

- **Back Strength**: Builds spinal extensor muscles
- **Core Stability**: Maintains neutral under load
- **Hip Flexor Work**: Anchors position during hinge
- **Postural Support**: Strengthens posture muscles

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Arching lower back** - Keep spine straight, not arched
2. **Leading with chin** - Keep neck long
3. **Going too far** - Quality over range
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe steadily

## Tips for Success

- Think of your body as one long board
- Engage your core before you hinge
- Keep your gaze forward, not up
