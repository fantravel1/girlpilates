The Sumo Squat uses a wide stance to target the inner thighs and glutes more intensively than regular squats.

## Wide and Low

This variation changes the muscle emphasis by positioning the legs in a wider, turned-out stance.

## Benefits

- **Inner Thigh Work**: Targets adductors more
- **Glute Emphasis**: Different angle for glutes
- **Hip Opening**: Wide stance opens hips
- **Lower Body Strength**: Full leg workout

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Knees caving** - Push knees out over toes
2. **Leaning forward** - Keep chest proud
3. **Rising on toes** - Keep heels down
4. **Stance too narrow** - Go wide for sumo effect

## Tips for Success

- Point toes in the direction your knees will bend
- Keep your torso as upright as possible
- Push through your heels to stand
