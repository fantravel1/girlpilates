Clamshell Pulses add an intensity boost to the classic clamshell by incorporating small pulsing movements at the top of the lift, creating sustained muscle engagement.

## Pulse for the Burn

The pulsing action keeps your glute medius under constant tension, which helps build strength and endurance more quickly than standard repetitions.

## Benefits

- **Glute Activation**: Sustained engagement of the outer glute
- **Hip Stability**: Strengthens muscles that stabilize the hip joint
- **Muscle Endurance**: Pulses build muscular stamina
- **Low Impact**: Easy on the joints while still challenging

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rocking backward** - Keep hips stacked throughout
2. **Big pulse movements** - Keep pulses small and controlled
3. **Losing foot connection** - Feet stay pressed together
4. **Rushing** - Maintain control and tension

## Tips for Success

- Focus on squeezing your glute, not just lifting your knee
- Keep your core engaged to prevent rotation
- Breathe steadily throughout the pulses
