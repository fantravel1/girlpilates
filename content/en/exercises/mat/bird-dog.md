Bird Dog is a fundamental stability exercise that challenges your core to maintain a neutral spine while opposite limbs extend. It's excellent for building coordination and back health.

## The Balancing Act

By reducing your base of support to just one hand and one knee, this exercise forces your deep stabilizers to work overtime.

## Benefits

- **Core Stability**: Deep stabilizers must engage to prevent rotation
- **Back Health**: Strengthens without compressing the spine
- **Coordination**: Opposite limb pattern challenges the brain
- **Balance**: Reduced base requires precise control

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Hips rotating** - Keep them square to the floor
2. **Back arching** - Maintain neutral spine
3. **Rushing** - Slow, controlled movement
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe throughout

## Tips for Success

- Think of reaching long, not lifting high
- Keep your gaze between your hands
- Imagine a glass of water on your lower back - don't spill it
