faq:
  - q: "My lower back arches when I lift my leg. What should I do?"
    a: "Engage your core more and don't lift your leg as high."
  - q: "Should I point or flex my foot?"
    a: "Either is fine. Pointing elongates the leg, flexing engages more of the back of the leg."
  - q: "How high should I lift my leg?"
    a: "Only until your leg is parallel to the floor. Higher isn't better."

Quadruped Leg Reach challenges your core stability while working your glutes. It teaches you to extend your hip without compromising spinal alignment.

## Reach and Stabilize

This exercise builds glute strength while training your core to maintain position as your leg moves.

## Benefits

- **Glute Activation**: Extends hip using glute muscles
- **Core Stability**: Maintains neutral spine during leg movement
- **Hip Extension**: Improves hip extension range
- **Anti-Extension**: Core works to prevent back arching

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Back arching** - Keep spine neutral, don't hyperextend
2. **Hip hiking** - Keep hips level throughout
3. **Rushing** - Slow, controlled movements
4. **Forgetting to breathe** - Breathe steadily

## Tips for Success

- Think of reaching your heel toward the wall behind you
- Squeeze your glute at the top of the lift
- Keep your neck long, gaze between your hands
