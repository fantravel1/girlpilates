Spine Stretch Side creates length through the lateral body, stretching the obliques, lats, and intercostal muscles. This simple but effective stretch improves lateral mobility.

## Lengthen Your Side Body

This seated stretch targets the often-neglected lateral muscles, creating space between the ribs and promoting fuller breathing.

## Benefits

- **Lateral Flexibility**: Stretches side body
- **Rib Mobility**: Opens intercostal spaces
- **Spinal Mobility**: Promotes lateral flexion
- **Breath Access**: Creates space for deeper breathing

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Lifting hip** - Keep both sit bones down
2. **Rotating** - Keep chest facing forward
3. **Collapsing** - Maintain length as you reach
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe into the stretch

## Tips for Success

- Think of reaching up and over, not just to the side
- Keep your opposite hip grounded
- Breathe into the opening side
