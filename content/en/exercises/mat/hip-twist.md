The Hip Twist is an advanced exercise that challenges core control through circular leg movements while balancing on the sit bones.

## Circle With Control

This exercise requires significant core strength to maintain balance while the legs draw circles in space.

## Benefits

- **Core Control**: Intense abdominal challenge
- **Hip Flexor Strength**: Holds legs in space
- **Balance**: Challenges seated balance
- **Oblique Work**: Controls rotational movement

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Falling back** - Maintain balance on sit bones
2. **Legs separating** - Keep legs squeezed together
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe throughout circles
4. **Circles too big** - Start small and controlled

## Tips for Success

- Think of drawing perfect circles with your feet
- Keep your chest lifted throughout
- Use your hands for support until strength builds
