Hip Circles Kneeling is a gentle mobility exercise that warms up the hips and lower back through circular movements.

## Circle to Mobilize

This exercise helps release tension in the lower back and hips while warming up for more challenging movements.

## Benefits

- **Hip Mobility**: Loosens hip joints
- **Lower Back Relief**: Releases lumbar tension
- **Warm Up**: Prepares body for exercise
- **Body Awareness**: Connects to hip movement

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Moving arms** - Keep upper body stable
2. **Holding breath** - Breathe naturally
3. **Rushing** - Move slowly and smoothly
4. **Uneven circles** - Keep circles balanced

## Tips for Success

- Think of drawing circles on the floor with your hips
- Keep your core gently engaged throughout
- Move smoothly without jerking
