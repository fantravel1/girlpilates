Supine Spinal Twist is a restorative stretch that rotates the spine and releases lower back tension.

## Twist and Relax

This passive stretch allows gravity to gently rotate the spine.

## Benefits

- **Spinal Rotation**: Gently rotates vertebrae
- **Back Release**: Relieves lower back tension
- **Chest Opener**: Stretches chest muscles
- **Restorative**: Calming and relaxing

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forcing twist** - Let gravity do the work
2. **Lifting shoulder** - Keep both down
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe deeply
4. **Rushing** - Hold for adequate time

## Tips for Success

- Relax completely into the stretch
- Use breath to deepen the twist
- Keep movements slow and gentle
