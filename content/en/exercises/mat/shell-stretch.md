Shell Stretch (also known as Child's Pose) is a restful position that gently stretches the entire back and provides a moment of relaxation during or after a workout.

## Rest and Restore

This pose allows the spine to decompress and the back muscles to release, making it perfect for rest between exercises or as a cool-down.

## Benefits

- **Back Relief**: Gently stretches the entire spine
- **Hip Opening**: Stretches the hips in flexion
- **Relaxation**: Promotes parasympathetic nervous system
- **Breath Focus**: Encourages deep, calming breaths

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forcing the fold** - Go only as far as comfortable
2. **Tensing shoulders** - Let them relax
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe deeply throughout
4. **Rushing** - Take time to really relax

## Tips for Success

- Let gravity do the work of stretching
- Focus on your breath expanding your back
- Use this pose whenever you need a rest
