Leg Pull Variations challenge plank stability by adding single leg lifts and rocking movements.

## Lift and Rock

These variations build on the basic plank by adding dynamic leg movements that challenge stability.

## Benefits

- **Core Stability**: Maintains plank while moving
- **Glute Activation**: Lifts strengthen posterior
- **Shoulder Strength**: Supports body weight
- **Balance**: Single leg challenges stability

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Dropping hips** - Keep body in straight line
2. **Rotating pelvis** - Keep hips square
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe throughout
4. **Lifting leg too high** - Quality over height

## Tips for Success

- Think of lengthening leg behind you, not just lifting
- Keep your core braced throughout
- Maintain a straight line from head to heel
