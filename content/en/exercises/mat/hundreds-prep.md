Hundreds Prep builds the endurance and proper form needed for the full Hundred exercise. It's the perfect stepping stone for beginners.

## Building Toward the Hundred

The classic Hundred is one of the most iconic Pilates exercises. This prep version helps you develop the strength and technique to eventually perform the full exercise.

## Benefits

- **Core Endurance**: Build stamina for holding abdominal contractions
- **Breathing Practice**: Coordinate breath with movement
- **Foundation Building**: Prepare for more advanced ab work
- **Circulation**: Arm pumping increases blood flow

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Neck strain** - Keep gaze forward, chin slightly tucked
2. **Shoulders tensed** - Keep shoulders away from ears
3. **Losing tabletop** - Maintain 90-degree angle at hips and knees
4. **Shallow breathing** - Full inhales and exhales

## Tips for Success

- Imagine your arms are pumping through water
- Keep your lower back pressed gently into the mat
- If neck tires, take a break then continue
