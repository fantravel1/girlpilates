Side Bend is one of the most beautiful exercises in Pilates. The graceful arc opens the entire side body while demanding serious strength from your obliques and shoulders.

## Strength Meets Grace

This exercise exemplifies the Pilates principle of controlled, flowing movement. It requires strength but should look effortless.

## Benefits

- **Oblique Strength**: Primary muscles working to lift the arc
- **Shoulder Stability**: Supporting arm builds shoulder strength
- **Side Body Stretch**: Arc stretches the entire lateral line
- **Core Integration**: Everything works together

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Sinking into shoulder** - Press away from floor
2. **Hips sagging** - Keep body in one straight line
3. **Rushed movement** - Flow with control
4. **Forgetting to breathe** - Inhale to lift, exhale to lower

## Tips for Success

- Imagine you're arcing over a giant beach ball
- Keep your bottom waist lifted throughout
- The arm sweep adds beauty but isn't essential for benefits
