The Pilates Push-Up is traditionally the final exercise in the classical mat sequence. It brings everything together: standing balance, spinal articulation, and upper body strength.

## The Grand Finale

This exercise incorporates so many Pilates principles: control, concentration, centering, flow, and precision. It's a fitting end to any mat practice.

## Benefits

- **Full Body Integration**: Works everything from head to toe
- **Upper Body Strength**: Push-ups build chest and arm strength
- **Spinal Articulation**: Rolling down and up mobilizes the spine
- **Hamstring Stretch**: Forward fold stretches the back of legs

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rushing the roll-down** - Move vertebra by vertebra
2. **Elbows flaring** - Keep them close to body in push-up
3. **Losing core engagement** - Stay connected throughout
4. **Holding breath** - Maintain rhythmic breathing

## Tips for Success

- Think of the entire sequence as one flowing movement
- The walk-out should be exactly 3 hand walks
- Return to standing with as much control as you went down
