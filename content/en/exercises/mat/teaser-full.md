The full Teaser is one of the most iconic Pilates exercises. This challenging V-sit requires significant core strength, hip flexor control, and spinal articulation.

## The Ultimate Core Challenge

This classical exercise tests your ability to roll up with control while maintaining a balanced V-shape.

## Benefits

- **Core Strength**: Intense abdominal workout
- **Spinal Articulation**: Rolls through each vertebra
- **Balance**: Challenges seated balance
- **Control**: Requires precise movement control

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using momentum** - Roll with pure control
2. **Legs too low** - Keep legs at 45+ degrees
3. **Collapsing in balance** - Stay lifted
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe with the movement

## Tips for Success

- Reach your arms and legs toward each other
- Find your balance point on sit bones
- Use your exhale to power the roll up
