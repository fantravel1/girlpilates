Hip Circles Prone combines hip mobility work with glute strengthening. The circular movement helps lubricate the hip joint while building strength.

## Mobility Meets Strength

This exercise works your glutes while simultaneously improving hip range of motion and joint health.

## Benefits

- **Hip Mobility**: Circular motion improves joint range
- **Glute Activation**: Lifting leg engages glutes
- **Joint Health**: Helps distribute synovial fluid
- **Core Stability**: Requires core engagement to prevent rotation

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Lifting too high** - Keep lift minimal
2. **Rotating hips** - Keep both hip bones on mat
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe throughout
4. **Moving too fast** - Slow, controlled circles

## Tips for Success

- Imagine drawing perfect circles on the ceiling with your foot
- Keep your hips pressing into the mat
- Focus on smooth, continuous movement
