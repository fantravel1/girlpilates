Windshield Wipers is a dynamic core exercise that combines rotation with control. The movement mimics windshield wipers swaying side to side.

## Controlled Rotation

This exercise challenges your obliques and core to control the lowering and lifting of your legs while maintaining proper spinal alignment.

## Benefits

- **Oblique Strength**: Rotational movement targets obliques
- **Hip Flexibility**: Stretches hip flexors and outer hips
- **Core Control**: Requires significant core engagement
- **Spinal Mobility**: Gentle rotation through the spine

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Back arching** - Keep lower back pressed into mat
2. **Shoulders lifting** - Keep both shoulders grounded
3. **Using momentum** - Slow, controlled movements only
4. **Legs separating** - Keep legs pressed together

## Tips for Success

- Move slowly - this isn't about speed
- Think of your legs as one unit moving together
- Use your exhale to help control the movement
