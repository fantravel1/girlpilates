Prone Leg Lifts isolate the glutes and hamstrings in a position that's safe for most bodies. It's an excellent way to build posterior strength without loading the spine.

## Glute Isolation

This exercise teaches you to fire your glutes without compensating with your lower back - a skill that translates to better movement in all activities.

## Benefits

- **Glute Strengthening**: Targets the gluteus maximus
- **Hamstring Activation**: Works the back of the thigh
- **Core Stability**: Abs must engage to protect the spine
- **Hip Extension Practice**: Builds functional hip mobility

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Back arching** - Keep abs engaged, don't lift too high
2. **Hip rotation** - Keep hips level throughout
3. **Using momentum** - Slow, controlled lifts
4. **Forgetting to breathe** - Exhale on the lift

## Tips for Success

- Think of reaching your leg long rather than lifting high
- Squeeze your glute before you lift
- Keep your hipbones pressing into the mat
