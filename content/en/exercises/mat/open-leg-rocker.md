faq:
  - q: "I can't straighten my legs. Is that okay?"
    a: "Yes! Work with bent knees until hamstring flexibility improves. The rolling and balance are more important."
  - q: "I keep falling to one side when rolling."
    a: "This indicates a core imbalance. Focus on engaging both sides of your abs equally and roll straight back."
  - q: "How do I stop at the top without falling forward?"
    a: "Engage your deep abs strongly on the way up and think of lifting your chest rather than throwing your head forward."

Open Leg Rocker takes the playful rolling of Rolling Like a Ball and adds the challenge of extended legs. It's a beautiful combination of flexibility, balance, and control.

## Rolling with Extension

The extended legs make this exercise significantly more challenging than Rolling Like a Ball. Your hamstrings must be flexible, and your core must be strong.

## Benefits

- **Balance Mastery**: Holding the V-shape requires precise control
- **Hamstring Flexibility**: Extended legs stretch the hamstrings
- **Spinal Massage**: Rolling massages each vertebra
- **Core Strength**: Stopping at balance point challenges deep abs

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rolling onto neck** - Stop at shoulder blades every time
2. **Using momentum** - Control the roll with your abs
3. **Closing the V** - Maintain leg separation throughout
4. **Throwing head forward** - Lead with chest, not head

## Tips for Success

- Think of your body as a rocking chair with perfect form
- Keep your gaze between your legs throughout
- The shape stays the same - only your position changes
