Leg Pull Back is the reverse companion to Leg Pull Front. While Front works the anterior chain in a plank, Back challenges the entire posterior chain in reverse plank.

## The Back Body Builder

This exercise strengthens everything you can't see in the mirror: glutes, hamstrings, back muscles, and rear deltoids.

## Benefits

- **Posterior Chain Strength**: Works glutes, hamstrings, and back
- **Shoulder Stability**: Arms support full body weight
- **Hip Extension**: Lifting hips opens the front body
- **Balance**: Leg lift challenges stability

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Hips sagging** - Keep them lifted throughout
2. **Head dropping back** - Keep neck neutral
3. **Locked elbows** - Maintain soft bend
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe through the effort

## Tips for Success

- Press firmly through your heels
- Think of lifting your chest to the ceiling
- The stronger your glutes squeeze, the higher your hips stay
