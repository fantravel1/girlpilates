steps:
  - "Begin on hands and knees in tabletop position"
  - "Start by tucking chin and rounding through upper spine"
  - "Let the wave continue through mid and lower spine"
  - "Reverse by lifting tailbone, then opening through chest"
  - "Create smooth, continuous wave motion. Repeat 8-10 times"

modifications:
  - name: "Smaller Wave"
    level: "easier"
    description: "Focus on smaller segments of the spine"

    description: "Thread arm under body as spine rounds"

faq:
  - q: "Should I feel each vertebra move?"
    a: "Ideally yes - try to articulate through each spinal segment smoothly."
  - q: "How fast should I move?"
    a: "Slow and controlled, like a wave moving through water."
  - q: "Is this the same as cat-cow?"
    a: "Similar concept but spine wave emphasizes sequential articulation."

The Spine Wave creates flowing, sequential movement through the entire spine. This exercise promotes spinal mobility and develops awareness of each vertebral segment.

## Wave Through Your Spine

This exercise teaches you to articulate through each segment of your spine, creating smooth, fluid movement rather than moving the spine as one rigid unit.

## Benefits

- **Spinal Mobility**: Moves each vertebra independently
- **Body Awareness**: Develops kinesthetic sense of spine
- **Circulation**: Increases blood flow to spinal structures
- **Relaxation**: Releases tension through flowing movement

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Moving too fast** - Slow down to feel each segment
2. **Skipping sections** - Include entire spine in the wave
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe continuously with the movement
4. **Forcing range** - Stay within comfortable mobility

## Tips for Success

- Think of your spine as a string of pearls moving one at a time
- Start the movement from your head or tailbone
- Keep the motion continuous and smooth
