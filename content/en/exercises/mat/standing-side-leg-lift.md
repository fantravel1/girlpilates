Standing Side Leg Lift strengthens the outer hip and hip abductors while challenging balance.

## Lift to the Side

This functional exercise builds the muscles that stabilize the pelvis during walking and standing.

## Benefits

- **Hip Abductor Strength**: Works outer thigh and hip
- **Balance**: Challenges single-leg stability
- **Functional**: Supports walking and daily movement
- **Pelvis Stability**: Strengthens stabilizers

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Tilting pelvis** - Keep hips level as you lift
2. **Leaning away** - Stay tall over standing leg
3. **Rushing** - Lift and lower with control
4. **Lifting too high** - Quality over height

## Tips for Success

- Think of leading with your heel, not toe
- Keep your standing hip strong and stable
- Move slowly and with control
