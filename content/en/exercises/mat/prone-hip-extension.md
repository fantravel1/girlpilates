Prone Hip Extension is a simple yet effective exercise for strengthening the posterior chain.

## Lift and Squeeze

This accessible movement builds glute strength without complex positioning.

## Benefits

- **Glute Activation**: Targets gluteus maximus
- **Lower Back Support**: Strengthens back extensors
- **Hip Extension**: Improves hip mobility
- **Simple Movement**: Easy to learn and perform

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Lifting too high** - Keep movement small
2. **Rolling hips** - Keep pelvis stable
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe naturally
4. **Using momentum** - Lift with control

## Tips for Success

- Focus on squeezing the glute
- Keep core lightly engaged
- Move slowly and deliberately
