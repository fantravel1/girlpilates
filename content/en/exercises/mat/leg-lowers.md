Leg Lowers challenge core stability by lowering both legs toward the floor while keeping the lower back pressed into the mat.

## Lower With Control

This exercise tests your core's ability to maintain spinal stability against the weight of your lowering legs.

## Benefits

- **Core Strength**: Intense abdominal work
- **Hip Flexor Endurance**: Works hip flexors eccentrically
- **Spinal Stability**: Maintains neutral spine
- **Control**: Develops slow, controlled movement

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Back arching** - Keep lower back on mat
2. **Going too low** - Quality over range
3. **Holding breath** - Exhale as you lower
4. **Rushing** - Move slowly and controlled

## Tips for Success

- Press your lower back firmly into the mat
- Only lower to where you can maintain control
- Use your exhale to support the movement
