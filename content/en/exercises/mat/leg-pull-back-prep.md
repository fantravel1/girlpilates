Leg Pull Back Prep develops the posterior chain strength needed for the full Leg Pull Back exercise. This variation teaches reverse plank alignment while adding hip flexion challenge.

## Strengthen Your Back Body

This exercise builds strength through the entire posterior chain - glutes, hamstrings, and back - while challenging hip flexor control.

## Benefits

- **Posterior Chain**: Strengthens glutes, hamstrings, back
- **Arm Strength**: Works triceps and shoulders
- **Hip Flexor Control**: Lifts leg against gravity
- **Core Stability**: Maintains alignment during movement

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Hips sagging** - Keep hips lifted throughout
2. **Shoulders shrugging** - Press shoulders down
3. **Head dropping back** - Keep neck neutral
4. **Rushing** - Control the movement

## Tips for Success

- Push the floor away with your hands
- Squeeze your glutes to support your hips
- Look straight ahead or slightly up
