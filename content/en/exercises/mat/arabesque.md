Arabesque is a ballet-inspired standing balance that strengthens the posterior chain while challenging stability.

## Balance Like a Dancer

This elegant exercise develops poise, balance, and strength in the back body while challenging single-leg stability.

## Benefits

- **Posterior Chain**: Strengthens glutes and hamstrings
- **Balance**: Challenges single-leg stability
- **Posture**: Encourages upright carriage
- **Grace**: Develops elegant movement quality

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Twisting hips** - Keep hips square to front
2. **Rounding back** - Maintain long spine
3. **Locking knee** - Keep slight softness in standing leg
4. **Holding breath** - Breathe naturally throughout

## Tips for Success

- Think of reaching your leg long behind you
- Keep your standing hip stable and strong
- Focus your gaze on a fixed point for balance
