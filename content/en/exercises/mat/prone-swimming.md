Prone Swimming is a dynamic back exercise that strengthens the entire posterior chain through alternating movement.

## Swim on the Mat

This exercise mimics swimming motion to work back, glutes, and shoulders simultaneously.

## Benefits

- **Back Strength**: Works erector spinae
- **Glute Activation**: Engages gluteus maximus
- **Coordination**: Alternating pattern challenges brain
- **Endurance**: Sustained movement builds stamina

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Lifting too high** - Keep movement moderate
2. **Holding breath** - Breathe rhythmically
3. **Tensing neck** - Keep neck neutral
4. **Losing rhythm** - Maintain steady pace

## Tips for Success

- Keep gaze down to protect neck
- Imagine swimming through water
- Focus on length rather than height
