Crab Prep develops the rolling and coordination skills needed for the classical Crab exercise. This preparation teaches the movement patterns in a safe progression.

## Roll and Switch

This exercise combines rolling with a cross-legged position and ankle switching, building toward the more complex full Crab exercise.

## Benefits

- **Rolling Control**: Develops smooth spinal articulation
- **Hip Flexibility**: Works in crossed leg position
- **Coordination**: Times the ankle switch with roll
- **Core Strength**: Maintains position throughout

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rolling off center** - Stay on your spine
2. **Rushing the switch** - Take time to switch cleanly
3. **Losing grip** - Maintain hold on feet
4. **Tensing neck** - Keep neck relaxed

## Tips for Success

- Keep your ball shape compact
- Switch your cross when legs are overhead
- Use your exhale to power the roll
