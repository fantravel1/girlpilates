Spine Stretch Twist combines the classic spine stretch forward with rotation, mobilizing the entire spine.

## Twist and Stretch

This exercise adds rotation to flexion, creating a comprehensive spinal mobility exercise.

## Benefits

- **Spinal Mobility**: Combines flexion and rotation
- **Oblique Work**: Rotation engages obliques
- **Hamstring Stretch**: Lengthens back of legs
- **Breath Work**: Coordinates movement with breath

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Lifting hips** - Keep both sit bones grounded
2. **Rushing** - Move slowly with control
3. **Shallow breath** - Use deep exhalations
4. **Rounding from neck** - Initiate from lower spine

## Tips for Success

- Keep your sit bones grounded as you rotate
- Use your exhale to deepen the stretch
- Imagine wringing out your spine like a towel
