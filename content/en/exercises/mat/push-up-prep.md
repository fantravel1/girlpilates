Push Up Prep builds the upper body strength needed for full push-ups while teaching proper alignment and form.

## Build Your Foundation

Push-ups are challenging. This prep version allows you to develop strength gradually while maintaining excellent form.

## Benefits

- **Upper Body Strength**: Works chest, shoulders, and triceps
- **Core Engagement**: Requires core stability throughout
- **Proper Form**: Teaches correct alignment before progressing
- **Confidence**: Builds toward full push-ups

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Hips sagging** - Keep body in straight line
2. **Elbows flaring** - Keep elbows at 45 degrees
3. **Head dropping** - Keep neck in line with spine
4. **Holding breath** - Exhale on the push up

## Tips for Success

- Think of your body as one solid plank
- Lower with control, push up with power
- Quality over quantity - stop when form breaks down
