Hip Extension Prone is a fundamental exercise for strengthening the glutes and teaching proper hip extension.

## Lift to Strengthen

This exercise isolates the hip extension movement, targeting the glutes without stressing the lower back.

## Benefits

- **Glute Strength**: Targets gluteus maximus
- **Hip Extension**: Teaches proper movement pattern
- **Back Support**: Strengthens posterior chain
- **Simple**: Easy to learn and perform

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Lifting too high** - Don't over-arch lower back
2. **Bending knee** - Keep leg straight unless modifying
3. **Rotating hip** - Keep hips square to floor
4. **Rushing** - Move with control

## Tips for Success

- Squeeze your glute before you lift
- Think of reaching your leg long behind you
- Keep your hip bones pressed into the mat
