Chest Opener Prone is an effective way to stretch tight chest and anterior shoulder muscles.

## Roll and Open

This supported stretch targets the chronically tight chest area.

## Benefits

- **Chest Release**: Opens pectoralis muscles
- **Shoulder Stretch**: Targets anterior deltoid
- **Counter Sitting**: Reverses rounded posture
- **Passive Stretch**: Gravity does the work

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forcing too deep** - Let gravity work
2. **Tensing neck** - Keep relaxed
3. **Rushing** - Hold for adequate time
4. **Wrong arm angle** - Experiment for best stretch

## Tips for Success

- Find the arm angle that gives best stretch
- Breathe deeply into chest
- Relax completely into the stretch
