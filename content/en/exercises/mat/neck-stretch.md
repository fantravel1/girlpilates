Neck Stretch releases tension in the neck and upper trapezius muscles that accumulate from stress, computer work, and poor posture.

## Release Neck Tension

The neck holds tremendous tension for most people. This simple stretch can provide immediate relief and help prevent headaches.

## Benefits

- **Neck Relief**: Releases tension in neck muscles
- **Upper Trap Stretch**: Lengthens the upper trapezius
- **Headache Prevention**: Regular stretching can reduce tension headaches
- **Posture Support**: Reduces forward head posture

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forcing** - Never force a neck stretch
2. **Lifting shoulder** - Keep opposite shoulder down
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe deeply throughout
4. **Rushing** - Hold long enough to feel release

## Tips for Success

- Keep movements slow and gentle
- Think of lengthening one side of your neck
- Do this stretch several times throughout the day
