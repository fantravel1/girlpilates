Toe Dips teach core stability by challenging you to maintain a neutral spine while one leg moves. It's a fundamental exercise for building deep core control.

## Control Through Movement

This exercise trains the deep core muscles to stabilize the spine while a limb moves - a key skill for functional movement.

## Benefits

- **Deep Core Activation**: Targets transverse abdominis
- **Spine Stability**: Maintains neutral while legs move
- **Control**: Develops precise movement control
- **Foundation**: Builds toward more challenging exercises

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Back arching** - Keep lower back pressed into mat
2. **Moving too fast** - Slow, controlled movement
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe throughout
4. **Losing tabletop** - Keep knee angle at 90 degrees

## Tips for Success

- Focus on keeping your pelvis completely stable
- Move only from the hip - knee stays at 90 degrees
- Quality of movement matters more than range
