The Twist combines side plank stability with thoracic rotation. This challenging exercise builds strength and mobility through dynamic movement.

## Rotate From Stability

This advanced exercise requires you to maintain side plank alignment while adding a rotational challenge, building full body control.

## Benefits

- **Oblique Strength**: Intense lateral core work
- **Shoulder Stability**: Maintains position during rotation
- **Thoracic Mobility**: Rotates through mid-spine
- **Full Body Control**: Integrates multiple challenges

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Hips dropping** - Keep hips lifted throughout
2. **Over-rotating** - Control the range of rotation
3. **Holding breath** - Exhale as you twist
4. **Collapsing shoulder** - Keep shoulder strong

## Tips for Success

- Root firmly through your supporting hand
- Initiate the twist from your ribs
- Keep your hips stacked even as you rotate
