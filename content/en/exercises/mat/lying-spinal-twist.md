The Lying Spinal Twist is a restorative exercise that gently rotates the spine and releases tension in the back and hips. It's perfect for ending a workout or as a standalone stretch.

## Release and Restore

This gentle twist helps counteract the effects of sitting and forward-focused activities by rotating the spine in a supported position.

## Benefits

- **Spinal Mobility**: Gently rotates the spine through full range
- **Back Relief**: Releases tension in lower and mid back
- **Hip Opening**: Stretches outer hip and glutes
- **Relaxation**: Calms the nervous system

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forcing the twist** - Let gravity do the work
2. **Shoulders lifting** - Keep both shoulders grounded
3. **Holding breath** - Breathe deeply throughout
4. **Rushing** - This is meant to be slow and relaxing

## Tips for Success

- Use each exhale to release deeper into the stretch
- Keep your knees stacked on top of each other
- Close your eyes and relax into the position
