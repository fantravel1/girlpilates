Cobra is a fundamental back extension exercise that strengthens the spine extensors while opening the chest and front of the shoulders. It's essential for counteracting forward posture.

## Open the Front Body

This exercise reverses the hunched posture many of us develop from sitting and screen time, strengthening the back while stretching the front.

## Benefits

- **Back Strength**: Strengthens spine extensors and erector spinae
- **Chest Opening**: Stretches pectorals and front shoulders
- **Posture Improvement**: Counteracts forward-hunched posture
- **Spine Mobility**: Improves extension range of motion

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-extending** - Don't go higher than comfortable
2. **Pushing too hard** - Back muscles lift, hands just support
3. **Tensing shoulders** - Keep shoulders down away from ears
4. **Lifting legs** - Keep legs grounded

## Tips for Success

- Think of lengthening your spine as you lift, not just bending backward
- Keep your gaze forward or slightly down to protect your neck
- Squeeze your legs together for stability
