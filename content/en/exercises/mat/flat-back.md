Flat Back teaches the hip hinge pattern with a straight spine. This exercise builds awareness of spinal alignment while stretching the hamstrings.

## Hinge With Control

The flat back hinge is fundamental for safe movement and lifting. Learning to move from the hips while keeping the spine neutral protects your back.

## Benefits

- **Spinal Alignment**: Teaches neutral spine awareness
- **Hip Hinge**: Develops proper hinge pattern
- **Hamstring Stretch**: Lengthens back of legs
- **Back Strength**: Strengthens spinal extensors

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rounding spine** - Keep back flat throughout
2. **Leading with head** - Move from hips, not neck
3. **Forcing range** - Go only as far as spine stays flat
4. **Locking knees** - Keep soft bend if needed

## Tips for Success

- Imagine your spine is a straight board
- Move from your hip joints, not your waist
- Think of reaching your chest forward, not down
