Child's Pose is borrowed from yoga and used in Pilates as a rest position. It's the perfect counterpose after back extension work and a safe haven whenever you need a break.

## The Rest Stop

In any Pilates practice, Child's Pose is available to you. It's not weakness to rest - it's wisdom.

## Benefits

- **Back Stretch**: Gently stretches the entire back
- **Hip Opening**: Releases the hip flexors
- **Shoulder Stretch**: Arms extended stretches shoulders
- **Nervous System Calm**: The curled position soothes stress

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forcing it** - Use props if the position is uncomfortable
2. **Holding breath** - Breathe deeply and fully
3. **Rushing out** - Take your time coming up
4. **Skipping it** - Rest is part of practice

## Tips for Success

- This should feel good - if it doesn't, modify
- Use it between challenging exercises
- Focus on your breath - let each exhale release tension
