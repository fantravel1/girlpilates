Tabletop Leg Extensions challenge core stability by extending one leg while maintaining the tabletop position with the other. It's a progression from toe dips.

## Extend Your Challenge

This exercise increases the lever length, making your core work harder to maintain stability as one leg extends away from your body.

## Benefits

- **Core Stability**: Maintains neutral spine during leg extension
- **Hip Flexor Strength**: Works hip flexors through full range
- **Progression**: Builds on tabletop foundations
- **Control**: Develops precise leg control

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Back arching** - Keep lower back pressed into mat
2. **Extending too low** - Only go as low as back stays stable
3. **Rushing** - Move slowly with control
4. **Losing tabletop** - Keep static leg at 90 degrees

## Tips for Success

- Think of reaching your leg long as you extend
- Keep your pelvis absolutely still
- Start with leg higher and progress lower as strength builds
