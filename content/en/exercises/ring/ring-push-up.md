## Starting Position
Place the Magic Circle flat on the mat. Position your hands on top of the ring, slightly wider than shoulder-width. Step back into a plank position with your body in a straight line from head to heels.

## Execution
1. Engage your core and stabilize your body on the ring
2. Bend your elbows to lower your chest toward the ring
3. Keep your elbows at about a 45-degree angle from your body
4. Press back up to the starting plank position
5. Complete 6-10 repetitions with controlled movement

## Breathing
Inhale as you lower down. Exhale as you press back up.

## Tips
- Maintain a straight body line throughout the entire movement
- Press firmly into the ring to manage the instability
- Keep your core engaged to prevent your hips from sagging
- Move slowly and with control due to the unstable surface

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Perform on your knees, or do the exercise with hands on the mat and place the ring between your thighs
- **Harder:** Perform with feet elevated, or add a leg lift at the top of each push-up
