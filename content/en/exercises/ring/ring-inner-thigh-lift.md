## Starting Position
Lie on your right side with your body in a straight line. Prop yourself up on your right forearm. Bend your top (left) leg and place your foot flat on the mat in front of your bottom thigh. Place the Magic Circle under your bottom (right) ankle.

## Execution
1. Engage your core and stabilize your torso
2. Press down into the ring with your bottom leg, lifting it slightly off the mat
3. Hold the lift for 2 seconds while maintaining pressure on the ring
4. Lower your leg slowly back to the ring without fully relaxing
5. Complete 12-15 repetitions, then switch to the other side

## Breathing
Exhale as you press down and lift. Inhale as you lower.

## Tips
- Keep your hips stacked and avoid rolling forward or backward
- Focus on pressing down into the ring to engage your inner thigh
- Maintain a stable upper body throughout the movement
- Keep your bottom leg straight and lengthened

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Remove the ring and perform regular inner thigh lifts, or reduce the range of motion
- **Harder:** Add pulses at the top of the lift, or extend your top leg long instead of bending it
