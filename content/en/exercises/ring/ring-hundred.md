## Starting Position
Lie on your back with the Magic Circle between your ankles. Lift your legs to tabletop position (knees bent at 90 degrees) while squeezing the ring. Curl your head and shoulders off the mat, reaching your arms long by your sides, hovering just above the mat.

## Execution
1. Extend your legs to a 45-degree angle while maintaining the squeeze on the ring
2. Begin pumping your arms up and down in small, controlled movements
3. Pump for 5 counts on the inhale and 5 counts on the exhale
4. Continue for 100 total pumps (10 breath cycles)
5. Maintain constant pressure on the ring throughout

## Breathing
Inhale for 5 arm pumps, exhale for 5 arm pumps. Repeat for 10 cycles.

## Tips
- Keep your lower back pressing into the mat throughout
- Maintain a steady squeeze on the ring between your ankles
- Keep your neck long and shoulder blades off the mat
- If your neck fatigues, lower your head briefly then lift again

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Keep legs in tabletop position or raise them higher toward the ceiling
- **Harder:** Lower your legs closer to the mat while maintaining neutral spine
