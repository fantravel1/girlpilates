## Starting Position
Lie face down on the mat with legs extended and slightly apart. Hold the Magic Circle between your palms with arms extended forward, hovering just above the mat. Engage your core and lift your chest slightly off the mat.

## Execution
1. Lift both arms and both legs off the mat while squeezing the ring
2. Begin alternating lifting your right arm and left leg higher, then left arm and right leg
3. Move in a swimming motion with continuous, flowing alternations
4. Maintain the squeeze on the ring throughout the movement
5. Continue swimming for 20-30 seconds

## Breathing
Inhale for 5 counts of swimming. Exhale for 5 counts. Continue this pattern.

## Tips
- Keep your gaze down toward the mat to maintain neck alignment
- Engage your glutes and back muscles to support the position
- Move with rhythm and control, not speed
- Maintain constant gentle pressure on the ring

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Keep your legs on the mat and only perform the arm movements, or take breaks as needed
- **Harder:** Increase the tempo while maintaining control, or hold the extended position without the swimming motion
