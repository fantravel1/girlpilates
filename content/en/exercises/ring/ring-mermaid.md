## Starting Position
Sit with your legs folded to the right side in a mermaid position. Hold the Magic Circle between your palms overhead, arms extended with a slight bend in the elbows.

## Execution
1. Engage your core and sit tall, lengthening your spine
2. Press the ring gently and maintain the squeeze
3. Reach up and over to the left, creating a lateral stretch in your right side
4. Hold the stretch for 2-3 breaths while maintaining ring pressure
5. Return to center with control
6. Repeat 3-4 times, then switch leg position and stretch to the other side

## Breathing
Inhale to lengthen upward. Exhale as you reach over into the side bend. Breathe naturally while holding.

## Tips
- Keep both sit bones grounded on the mat
- Reach up and over rather than collapsing into the side bend
- Maintain gentle pressure on the ring to engage your upper body
- Keep your shoulders down away from your ears

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Sit cross-legged instead of in mermaid position, or reduce the depth of the side bend
- **Harder:** Hold the stretch longer, or add a rotation to look under your top arm
