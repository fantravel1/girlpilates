## Starting Position
Stand tall with feet hip-width apart, knees slightly bent. Place the Magic Circle between your thighs, just above the knees. Arms rest at your sides or on your hips for balance.

## Execution
1. Engage your core and lengthen through your spine
2. Squeeze the ring by pressing your thighs together, activating your inner thigh muscles
3. Hold the squeeze for 2-3 seconds, maintaining your upright posture
4. Release the pressure slowly without letting the ring drop
5. Repeat for 10-15 repetitions

## Breathing
Exhale as you squeeze the ring. Inhale as you release the pressure.

## Tips
- Keep your shoulders relaxed and down away from your ears
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the exercise
- Focus on engaging your inner thighs rather than your glutes
- Keep your knees soft and avoid locking them

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Perform gentler pulses instead of sustained squeezes, or place the ring lower between your calves
- **Harder:** Rise onto your toes while squeezing the ring, or perform single-leg variations by lifting one foot slightly off the ground
