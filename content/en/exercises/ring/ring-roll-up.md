## Starting Position
Lie on your back with legs extended long on the mat. Hold the Magic Circle overhead between your palms, arms extended with a slight bend in the elbows. Engage your core.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, pressing gently into the ring
2. Exhale as you curl your head and shoulders off the mat, reaching the ring toward the ceiling
3. Continue rolling up through your spine, one vertebra at a time, reaching the ring toward your toes
4. Inhale at the top, sitting tall with the ring extended forward
5. Exhale as you roll back down, articulating through your spine with control
6. Repeat for 6-8 repetitions

## Breathing
Inhale to prepare. Exhale to roll up. Inhale at the top. Exhale to roll down.

## Tips
- Keep constant gentle pressure on the ring throughout
- Roll through your spine sequentially, avoiding any jerky movements
- Keep your shoulders down away from your ears
- If you struggle to roll up, bend your knees slightly

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Bend your knees with feet flat, or use your hands on the mat for assistance
- **Harder:** Pause at different points during the roll up and down, or place the ring between your ankles and perform the roll up without arm assistance
