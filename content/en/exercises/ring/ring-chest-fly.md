## Starting Position
Stand or sit tall with good posture. Hold the Magic Circle in front of your chest with one hand on each pad, arms extended forward at shoulder height. The ring should be vertical.

## Execution
1. Engage your core and maintain a stable torso
2. Squeeze the ring by pressing your hands together, bringing your elbows toward each other
3. Hold the squeeze for 1-2 seconds at full compression
4. Slowly release and allow the ring to open slightly
5. Repeat the pressing motion for 12-15 repetitions

## Breathing
Exhale as you press the ring closed. Inhale as you allow it to open.

## Tips
- Keep your shoulders down and away from your ears
- Maintain a steady arm position at chest height throughout
- Focus on engaging your chest muscles to create the movement
- Keep your wrists aligned with your forearms

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Perform seated for more stability, or hold at waist height
- **Harder:** Perform while in a squat hold, or add a small forward reach as you squeeze
