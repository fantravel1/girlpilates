## Starting Position
Lie on your right side with your body in a straight line. Prop yourself up on your right forearm with elbow under shoulder. Place the Magic Circle between your ankles, with your bottom leg slightly forward.

## Execution
1. Engage your core to maintain a stable torso
2. Press the ring by squeezing your top leg down toward your bottom leg
3. Hold the squeeze for 2-3 seconds, engaging your outer thigh and glute
4. Release the pressure slowly without completely relaxing
5. Complete 10-12 repetitions, then switch to the other side

## Breathing
Exhale as you press the ring. Inhale as you release.

## Tips
- Keep your hips stacked vertically, don't let them roll forward or back
- Maintain length in your spine and engage your obliques
- Focus on pressing from your outer thigh and hip, not just your ankle
- Keep your neck aligned with your spine

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Lie with your back against a wall for support, or bend your bottom leg for more stability
- **Harder:** Lift both legs off the mat while squeezing the ring, or extend your top arm overhead for balance challenge
