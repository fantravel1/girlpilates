## Starting Position
Lie on your back with knees pulled into your chest. Curl your head and shoulders off the mat. Hold the Magic Circle between your palms at your shins, arms bent.

## Execution
1. Inhale as you extend your legs to a 45-degree angle and reach the ring overhead
2. Press the ring gently as you extend, creating a long line with your body
3. Exhale as you circle your arms around and return to the starting position
4. Pull your knees back into your chest, bringing the ring to your shins
5. Repeat for 8-10 repetitions

## Breathing
Inhale as you extend your legs and arms. Exhale as you circle back to the starting position.

## Tips
- Keep your lower back anchored to the mat throughout
- Maintain a consistent curl in your upper body
- Create a smooth, flowing circular motion with your arms
- Keep gentle pressure on the ring during the overhead reach

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Extend your legs higher toward the ceiling, or keep your head down on the mat
- **Harder:** Lower your legs closer to the mat, or add a hold at the extended position
