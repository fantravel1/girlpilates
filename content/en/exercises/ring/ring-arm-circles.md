## Starting Position
Stand or sit tall with excellent posture. Hold the Magic Circle between your palms at chest height, arms extended forward. The ring should be vertical with padding facing your palms.

## Execution
1. Press the ring gently and maintain the squeeze throughout
2. Begin making small circles with your arms, moving from the shoulders
3. Complete 8-10 circles in one direction
4. Reverse and complete 8-10 circles in the opposite direction
5. Keep the ring pressed and your arms extended throughout the movement

## Breathing
Breathe naturally and continuously. Exhale during the effortful part of the circle.

## Tips
- Keep your shoulders down and away from your ears
- Maintain consistent pressure on the ring throughout all circles
- Move from your shoulder joints, keeping your arms relatively straight
- Keep your torso stable and avoid swaying

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Make smaller circles or reduce the ring pressure
- **Harder:** Make larger circles, hold the ring overhead for circles, or perform while in a squat hold
