## Starting Position
Stand or sit tall with excellent posture. Hold the Magic Circle overhead between your palms, arms extended with elbows slightly soft. The ring should be horizontal with padding facing your palms.

## Execution
1. Engage your core to stabilize your torso and prevent arching
2. Press the ring by squeezing your palms together from above
3. Hold the squeeze for 2-3 seconds while maintaining arm position
4. Release the pressure slowly without dropping your arms
5. Repeat for 10-12 repetitions

## Breathing
Exhale as you press the ring. Inhale as you release.

## Tips
- Keep your ribs from flaring by engaging your core
- Maintain neutral alignment in your neck, don't let your head jut forward
- Keep your shoulders stable and down, away from your ears
- Ensure your arms stay in your peripheral vision, not behind your head

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Hold the ring at a 45-degree angle instead of fully overhead, or sit for more stability
- **Harder:** Perform while standing on one leg, or alternate with arm presses at chest level for combination work
