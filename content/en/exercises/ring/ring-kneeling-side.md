## Starting Position
Kneel on your right knee with your left leg extended straight to the side, foot flat on the mat. Hold the Magic Circle between your palms overhead, arms extended.

## Execution
1. Engage your core and press gently into the ring
2. Lean to the left, reaching the ring overhead as your hips shift right
3. Create a long arc with your body from your right knee through to your fingertips
4. Hold the position for 2-3 breaths while maintaining ring pressure
5. Return to the starting position with control
6. Repeat 4-5 times, then switch to the other side

## Breathing
Inhale to prepare. Exhale as you reach into the side bend. Breathe naturally while holding.

## Tips
- Keep your supporting knee directly under your hip
- Maintain length through both sides of your waist
- Press consistently into the ring to engage your upper body
- Keep your extended leg active and engaged

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Keep both knees down and perform a simpler side lean, or hold the ring at chest level
- **Harder:** Lift your supporting knee off the mat into a full side plank, or add pulses in the side bend position
