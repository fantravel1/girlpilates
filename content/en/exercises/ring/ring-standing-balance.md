## Starting Position
Stand on your right leg with your left knee lifted to hip height. Place the Magic Circle between your hands at chest level, arms extended forward.

## Execution
1. Find your balance on your standing leg while engaging your core
2. Squeeze the ring with your hands while maintaining balance
3. Hold the position for 5-10 seconds with steady breathing
4. Slowly extend your lifted leg forward while continuing to squeeze the ring
5. Return to the starting position
6. Repeat 5-6 times, then switch to the other leg

## Breathing
Breathe naturally and continuously throughout the exercise. Avoid holding your breath.

## Tips
- Fix your gaze on a single point to help maintain balance
- Keep your standing leg slightly soft, not locked
- Engage your core to stabilize your torso
- Maintain constant gentle pressure on the ring

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Keep your lifted toe touching the mat for support, or hold the ring at waist level
- **Harder:** Close your eyes while balancing, or move the ring overhead while maintaining balance
