## Starting Position
Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the mat, hip-width apart. Place the Magic Circle between your thighs, just above the knees. Arms rest alongside your body, palms down.

## Execution
1. Find a neutral spine position with natural curves in your lower back
2. Engage your core by drawing your navel gently toward your spine
3. Squeeze the ring by pressing your thighs together, activating your inner thighs
4. Hold the squeeze for 2-3 seconds while maintaining stable pelvis
5. Release the pressure slowly and repeat for 10-15 repetitions

## Breathing
Exhale as you squeeze the ring. Inhale as you release.

## Tips
- Keep your pelvis stable and avoid tilting or rocking
- Maintain length in the back of your neck
- Focus the work in your inner thighs, not your hip flexors
- Keep your feet firmly planted on the mat

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Place the ring between your calves or ankles for less resistance
- **Harder:** Lift your feet off the mat into tabletop position while squeezing the ring, or extend legs to 45 degrees
