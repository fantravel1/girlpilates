## Starting Position
Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the mat. Place the Magic Circle between your knees. Lift into a bridge position with hips elevated, creating a straight line from shoulders to knees.

## Execution
1. Maintain the bridge position while squeezing the ring between your knees
2. Extend your right leg straight, lifting it to knee height
3. Lower and lift the extended leg in small pulses for 3-5 reps
4. Return your right foot to the mat and repeat on the left side
5. After both sides, lower your hips back down with control
6. Repeat the full sequence 3-4 times

## Breathing
Exhale as you extend the leg. Inhale during the pulses. Maintain steady breathing throughout.

## Tips
- Keep your hips level and avoid dropping the lifted side
- Maintain constant pressure on the ring with the standing leg
- Engage your glutes and core to stabilize
- Keep your neck relaxed and shoulders grounded

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Hold the bridge with both feet down and just squeeze the ring, or reduce the number of pulses
- **Harder:** Hold the extended leg position longer, or perform with feet on tiptoes for added challenge
