## Starting Position
Lie on your back with both legs extended toward the ceiling. Curl your head and shoulders off the mat. Place the Magic Circle around your right ankle, holding it with both hands.

## Execution
1. Gently pull the right leg toward you with the ring, creating resistance
2. Extend the left leg away toward the mat in opposition
3. Switch legs in a scissoring motion, moving the ring to the left ankle
4. Continue alternating with a pulsing rhythm, pulling each leg twice
5. Complete 8-10 repetitions on each side

## Breathing
Exhale for two pulses on one leg. Inhale for two pulses on the other leg.

## Tips
- Keep your pelvis stable and avoid rocking side to side
- Maintain a strong connection between your ribs and hips
- Move with control and precision, not momentum
- Keep your legs as straight as possible

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Hold the ring with one hand and support your head with the other, or keep both legs higher
- **Harder:** Lower the extended leg closer to the mat, or increase the tempo while maintaining control
