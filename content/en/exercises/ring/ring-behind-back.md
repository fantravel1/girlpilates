## Starting Position
Stand tall with feet hip-width apart. Hold the Magic Circle behind your back at waist level, with one hand on each pad. Arms are slightly bent, and the ring is horizontal.

## Execution
1. Engage your core and roll your shoulders back and down
2. Press the ring by squeezing your hands toward each other from behind
3. Hold the squeeze for 2-3 seconds, feeling your shoulder blades draw together
4. Release the pressure slowly while maintaining good posture
5. Repeat for 10-12 repetitions

## Breathing
Exhale as you squeeze the ring. Inhale as you release.

## Tips
- Keep your chest open and avoid rounding your shoulders forward
- Maintain length in your spine without arching your lower back
- Focus on engaging your upper back muscles between your shoulder blades
- Keep your neck long and relaxed

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Hold the ring higher up your back near shoulder blade level, or perform lighter pulses
- **Harder:** Hold the ring lower near your glutes, or perform while in a slight forward hinge position
