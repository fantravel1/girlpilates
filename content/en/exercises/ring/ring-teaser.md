## Starting Position
Lie on your back with legs extended toward the ceiling at a 45-degree angle. Hold the Magic Circle between your palms, arms extended overhead on the mat behind you.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, pressing gently into the ring
2. Exhale as you roll up, lifting your arms and upper body to meet your legs
3. Balance in a V-position with legs at 45 degrees and arms reaching toward your feet
4. Hold the teaser position for 2-3 breaths, maintaining gentle pressure on the ring
5. Inhale as you slowly roll back down with control
6. Repeat for 5-6 repetitions

## Breathing
Inhale to prepare. Exhale to roll up. Breathe naturally while holding. Inhale to roll down.

## Tips
- Keep your chest open and shoulders down throughout
- Maintain length in your spine, avoid rounding excessively
- Focus on balance and control rather than speed
- Keep consistent gentle pressure on the ring to engage your upper body

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Bend your knees slightly, or perform a half teaser by keeping your feet on the mat
- **Harder:** Add pulses with the ring at the top position, or lower and lift your legs while maintaining the V-sit
