## Starting Position
Sit tall with legs extended straight in front of you, feet flexed. Hold the Magic Circle between your palms at chest height, arms extended forward. Engage your core and lengthen your spine.

## Execution
1. Press the ring gently and maintain the squeeze throughout
2. Rotate your torso to the right, keeping the ring at chest height
3. Hold the rotation for 1-2 seconds, maintaining tall posture
4. Return to center with control
5. Rotate to the left side
6. Complete 8-10 rotations on each side

## Breathing
Inhale at center. Exhale as you rotate to the side. Inhale to return to center.

## Tips
- Keep your hips grounded and facing forward throughout
- Lengthen up through your spine as you rotate
- Maintain constant gentle pressure on the ring
- Lead the rotation from your torso, not your arms

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Sit on a folded towel or cushion for support, or bend your knees slightly
- **Harder:** Extend your arms fully during rotation, or perform while sitting on an unstable surface
