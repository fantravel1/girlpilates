## Starting Position
Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the mat, hip-width apart. Place the Magic Circle between your knees. Arms rest alongside your body, palms down.

## Execution
1. Engage your core and squeeze the ring gently between your knees
2. Press through your feet and lift your hips off the mat, creating a straight line from shoulders to knees
3. Hold the bridge position for 2-3 seconds while maintaining the squeeze
4. Lower your hips back down with control, keeping pressure on the ring
5. Repeat for 10-12 repetitions

## Breathing
Inhale to prepare. Exhale as you lift into the bridge. Inhale at the top. Exhale to lower.

## Tips
- Keep your inner thighs engaged by maintaining pressure on the ring
- Avoid arching your lower back at the top of the bridge
- Press evenly through both feet
- Keep your neck long and relaxed

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Perform smaller lifts or reduce the ring pressure
- **Harder:** Hold the bridge and perform small pulses with the ring, or lift one leg extended while maintaining the bridge
