## Starting Position
Place the Magic Circle flat on the mat. Position your hands on top of the ring, shoulder-width apart. Step your feet back into a plank position with your body in a straight line from head to heels.

## Execution
1. Engage your core by drawing your navel toward your spine
2. Press down into the ring with your hands to activate your chest and arms
3. Hold the plank position, maintaining a neutral spine
4. Keep your body stable despite the instability of the ring
5. Hold for 20-30 seconds, building up to 60 seconds

## Breathing
Breathe naturally and continuously throughout the hold. Avoid holding your breath.

## Tips
- Keep your shoulders directly over your wrists
- Maintain a straight line from head to heels without sagging or piking
- Press firmly into the ring to engage your upper body
- Keep your neck neutral by looking at the mat between your hands

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Perform on your knees instead of toes, or place the ring on an elevated surface
- **Harder:** Lift one leg off the mat, or add shoulder taps while maintaining plank position
