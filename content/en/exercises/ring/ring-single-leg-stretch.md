## Starting Position
Lie on your back and bring both knees into your chest. Curl your head and shoulders off the mat. Place the Magic Circle around your right shin with both hands holding the ring. Extend your left leg to a 45-degree angle.

## Execution
1. Press gently into the ring with your shin while pulling it toward you
2. Hold for 1-2 seconds, keeping your core engaged
3. Switch the ring to your left shin as you extend your right leg
4. Continue alternating legs in a controlled, flowing motion
5. Complete 10-12 repetitions on each side

## Breathing
Exhale as you pull the knee in with the ring. Inhale as you switch legs.

## Tips
- Keep your lower back pressed into the mat throughout
- Maintain a steady curl in your upper body
- Move with control, not momentum
- Keep both hips level and stable

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Extend your leg higher toward the ceiling, or rest your head on the mat
- **Harder:** Extend your leg lower toward the mat, or increase the pace while maintaining control
