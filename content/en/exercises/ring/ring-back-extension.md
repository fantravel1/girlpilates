## Starting Position
Lie face down on the mat with legs extended long and together. Hold the Magic Circle between your palms, arms extended forward on the mat, creating a gentle squeeze.

## Execution
1. Engage your core and lengthen through your spine
2. Lift your head, chest, and arms off the mat while squeezing the ring
3. Keep your legs grounded and glutes engaged
4. Hold the lifted position for 2-3 seconds
5. Lower back down with control and repeat for 10-12 repetitions

## Breathing
Inhale to prepare. Exhale as you lift into extension. Inhale as you lower.

## Tips
- Keep your neck aligned with your spine, avoid looking up too high
- Focus on lengthening your spine rather than just lifting high
- Maintain constant gentle pressure on the ring
- Keep your shoulders down away from your ears

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Keep the ring on the mat and just lift your upper body, or perform smaller lifts
- **Harder:** Add a swimming motion with your arms while holding the ring, or lift your legs simultaneously for full extension
