## Starting Position
Stand or sit tall with good posture. Hold the Magic Circle between your palms at chest height, elbows bent and lifted to the sides at shoulder height. The ring should be vertical with padding facing your palms.

## Execution
1. Engage your core and draw your shoulders down away from your ears
2. Press the ring by squeezing your palms together, engaging your chest muscles
3. Hold the squeeze for 2-3 seconds while maintaining lifted elbows
4. Release the pressure slowly without dropping your elbows
5. Repeat for 10-15 repetitions

## Breathing
Exhale as you press the ring. Inhale as you release.

## Tips
- Keep your elbows at shoulder height throughout
- Maintain length in your spine without arching your back
- Focus on squeezing from your chest muscles, not just your arms
- Keep your wrists straight and aligned with your forearms

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Lower the ring to waist height or perform seated for more stability
- **Harder:** Hold the squeeze for longer periods (5-10 seconds), or perform while in a squat position
