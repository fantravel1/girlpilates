## Starting Position
Sit tall on your mat with legs extended forward, spine elongated and core engaged. Loop the resistance band around your feet and hold one end in each hand with arms extended forward at shoulder height, palms facing each other.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, lengthening through the crown of your head
2. Exhale as you pull your elbows back, drawing the band toward your ribcage
3. Squeeze your shoulder blades together as your elbows bend
4. Inhale as you slowly extend your arms forward, returning to the starting position
5. Repeat for 12-15 repetitions

## Breathing
Exhale as you row back and draw the band toward you. Inhale as you extend forward with control.

## Tips
- Keep your shoulders down away from your ears throughout the movement
- Maintain tall upright posture - avoid rounding your spine
- Lead the movement with your elbows, not your hands
- Think about squeezing a pencil between your shoulder blades at the peak

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use lighter resistance band or sit with knees slightly bent for more stability
- **Harder:** Use heavier resistance band or add a pause when elbows are fully bent
