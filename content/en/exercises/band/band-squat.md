## Starting Position
Stand tall with feet hip-width apart and the resistance band looped around your thighs just above your knees. Position your arms extended in front of you at shoulder height for balance. Engage your core and maintain neutral spine alignment.

## Execution
1. Inhale as you begin to bend your knees and lower your hips back and down
2. Press your knees out against the band to keep them aligned over your toes
3. Lower until your thighs are parallel to the floor (or as low as comfortable)
4. Exhale as you press through your heels to return to standing
5. Repeat for 12-15 repetitions

## Breathing
Inhale as you lower into the squat. Exhale as you press back up to standing.

## Tips
- Keep your knees pressing out against the band throughout the entire movement
- Maintain weight in your heels rather than your toes
- Keep your chest lifted and avoid rounding your upper back
- Ensure your knees track over your toes and don't collapse inward

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use lighter resistance band or reduce the depth of your squat
- **Harder:** Use heavier resistance band or hold the bottom position for 3-5 seconds before rising
