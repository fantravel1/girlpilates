## Starting Position
Stand on the center of the resistance band with feet hip-width apart. Hold one end of the band in each hand with arms extended down in front of your thighs. Stand tall with core engaged, shoulders back, and neutral spine alignment.

## Execution
1. Inhale as you hinge forward at your hips, pushing them back behind you
2. Keep your spine neutral and knees slightly soft as you lower your torso
3. Lower until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings, maintaining tension in the band
4. Exhale as you drive through your heels and squeeze your glutes to return to standing
5. Repeat for 12-15 repetitions

## Breathing
Inhale as you hinge forward. Exhale as you return to standing, engaging your glutes.

## Tips
- Lead with your hips, not your back - this is a hip hinge, not a back bend
- Keep the band close to your legs throughout the movement
- Maintain neutral spine - avoid rounding your lower back
- Keep your shoulders back and chest proud throughout

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use lighter resistance band or reduce the range of motion
- **Harder:** Use heavier resistance band or perform single-leg deadlifts for increased balance challenge
