## Starting Position
Lie on your back and loop the resistance band around the balls of your feet. Hold one end in each hand and extend your legs to a 45-degree angle (or higher if needed). Lift your head, neck, and shoulders off the mat, reaching your arms long by your sides with palms down.

## Execution
1. Inhale for 5 counts while pumping your arms up and down in small pulses
2. Exhale for 5 counts while continuing the arm pumps
3. Maintain stable torso and steady leg position throughout
4. Continue the pattern for a total of 100 arm pulses (10 full breath cycles)
5. Lower down with control after completing all repetitions

## Breathing
Inhale for 5 arm pumps. Exhale for 5 arm pumps. Repeat for 10 full cycles.

## Tips
- Keep your lower back connected to the mat - don't let it arch
- Maintain steady tension in the band by keeping your legs still
- Curl your upper body up using your abdominals, not your neck
- Keep your shoulders down away from your ears during arm pumps

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Bend your knees to 90 degrees or rest your head on the mat
- **Harder:** Lower your legs closer to the floor or increase the band tension
