## Starting Position
Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the mat hip-width apart. Loop the resistance band around your thighs just above your knees. Arms rest by your sides with palms down. Engage your core and maintain neutral spine.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, pressing your feet firmly into the mat
2. Exhale as you press your hips up toward the ceiling, creating a straight line from shoulders to knees
3. Simultaneously press your knees out against the band to maintain hip-width position
4. Inhale at the top, maintaining the lifted position
5. Exhale as you slowly lower your hips back down to the mat with control
6. Repeat for 12-15 repetitions

## Breathing
Exhale as you lift your hips up. Inhale at the top, then exhale as you lower down.

## Tips
- Keep your knees pressing out against the band throughout the entire movement
- Avoid arching your lower back - think of tucking your tailbone slightly
- Press through your heels rather than your toes
- Keep your shoulders relaxed and neck long

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use lighter resistance band or perform without the band initially
- **Harder:** Use heavier resistance band or hold the top position for 5-10 seconds before lowering
