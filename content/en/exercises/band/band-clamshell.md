## Starting Position
Lie on your right side with hips and knees bent at 45 degrees, legs stacked. Loop the resistance band around your thighs just above your knees. Rest your head on your right arm and place your left hand on the mat in front of you for stability.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, engaging your core and keeping your feet together
2. Exhale as you lift your top (left) knee toward the ceiling, keeping your feet together
3. Open your knee as far as comfortable while maintaining stable hips
4. Inhale as you slowly lower your knee back to the starting position with control
5. Complete 15-20 repetitions, then switch sides

## Breathing
Exhale as you open your top knee. Inhale as you close with control.

## Tips
- Keep your hips stacked - avoid rolling backward as you open your knee
- Maintain stable pelvis throughout - the movement comes from your hip, not your lower back
- Keep your feet together like a clamshell opening and closing
- Move with control and avoid using momentum

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use lighter resistance band or reduce the range of motion
- **Harder:** Use heavier resistance band or hold the open position for 3-5 seconds before closing
