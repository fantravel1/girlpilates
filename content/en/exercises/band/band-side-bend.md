## Starting Position
Stand on the center of the resistance band with feet hip-width apart. Hold both ends of the band in your right hand at your side. Place your left hand behind your head with elbow pointing out to the side. Stand tall with core engaged.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, lengthening through the crown of your head
2. Exhale as you bend directly to your left side, creating a lateral curve in your spine
3. Keep your hips stable and facing forward - avoid rotating
4. Inhale as you return to the upright starting position with control
5. Complete 10-12 repetitions, then switch sides

## Breathing
Exhale as you bend to the side. Inhale as you return to center.

## Tips
- Move purely in the lateral plane - avoid leaning forward or backward
- Keep both hips level and facing forward throughout
- Lengthen up and over rather than collapsing down
- Maintain steady tension in the band throughout the movement

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use lighter resistance band or reduce the range of motion
- **Harder:** Use heavier resistance band or hold the bent position for 2-3 seconds before returning
