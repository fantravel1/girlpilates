## Starting Position
Stand tall with the resistance band looped around both ankles. Hold onto a wall or chair for balance if needed. Shift your weight onto your left leg, keeping it slightly soft (not locked), and engage your core.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, lengthening through your spine and stabilizing your pelvis
2. Exhale as you lift your right leg out to the side, keeping it straight
3. Maintain level hips and avoid leaning your torso away from the moving leg
4. Inhale as you slowly lower your leg back to the starting position with control
5. Complete 12-15 repetitions, then switch legs

## Breathing
Exhale as you lift your leg out to the side. Inhale as you lower with control.

## Tips
- Keep your hips level and facing forward throughout the movement
- Avoid rotating your leg or turning your toes up - keep your foot facing forward
- Move with control and avoid swinging your leg
- Maintain strong core engagement to protect your lower back

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use lighter resistance band or hold onto a support for better balance
- **Harder:** Use heavier resistance band or perform the exercise lying on your side for increased resistance
