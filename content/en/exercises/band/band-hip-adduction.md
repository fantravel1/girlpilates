## Starting Position
Lie on your right side with your body in a straight line. Loop the resistance band around both ankles. Bend your top (left) leg and place the foot flat on the mat in front of your bottom leg for stability. Prop yourself up on your right forearm with your elbow under your shoulder.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, engaging your core and maintaining neutral spine alignment
2. Exhale as you lift your bottom (right) leg up toward the ceiling against the band
3. Keep your leg straight and your foot flexed throughout the movement
4. Inhale as you slowly lower your leg back to the mat with control
5. Complete 12-15 repetitions, then switch sides

## Breathing
Exhale as you lift your bottom leg up. Inhale as you lower with control.

## Tips
- Keep your hips stacked directly on top of each other
- Maintain length through your entire body - avoid collapsing into your supporting shoulder
- Move with precision and control rather than momentum
- Keep your neck long and aligned with your spine

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use lighter resistance band or perform without the band to master the movement first
- **Harder:** Use heavier resistance band or add a small pulse at the top of the movement
