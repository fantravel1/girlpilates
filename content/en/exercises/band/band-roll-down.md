## Starting Position
Stand tall with feet hip-width apart. Stand on the center of the resistance band and hold one end in each hand with arms by your sides. Create slight tension in the band. Engage your core and lengthen through your spine.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, growing tall through the crown of your head
2. Exhale as you nod your chin to your chest and roll down through your spine, one vertebra at a time
3. Let your arms extend down as you fold forward, feeling the band create resistance
4. Inhale at the bottom, allowing your head and arms to hang heavy
5. Exhale as you roll back up to standing, stacking one vertebra at a time
6. Repeat for 6-8 repetitions

## Breathing
Exhale as you roll down. Inhale at the bottom. Exhale as you roll back up.

## Tips
- Move sequentially through your spine like a wheel rolling along the ground
- Keep your abdominals engaged throughout to support your lower back
- Soften your knees slightly to protect your hamstrings
- Imagine peeling your spine off a wall as you roll down

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use lighter resistance band or perform without the band to master the articulation
- **Harder:** Use heavier resistance band or pause at the halfway point during the roll up
