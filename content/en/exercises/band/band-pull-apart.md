## Starting Position
Stand tall with feet hip-width apart. Hold the resistance band in front of you at chest height with both hands shoulder-width apart, arms extended, palms facing down. Create slight tension in the band.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, engaging your core and maintaining tall posture
2. Exhale as you pull the band apart, moving your hands out to the sides
3. Keep your arms straight and at chest height throughout the movement
4. Squeeze your shoulder blades together as the band reaches your chest
5. Inhale as you slowly return your hands to the starting position with control
6. Repeat for 12-15 repetitions

## Breathing
Exhale as you pull the band apart. Inhale as you return to center with control.

## Tips
- Keep your shoulders down and away from your ears
- Maintain straight arms throughout - avoid bending your elbows
- Focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together at the end of the movement
- Keep your chest lifted and avoid rounding your upper back

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use lighter resistance band or start with hands closer together
- **Harder:** Use heavier resistance band or hold the pulled position for 3-5 seconds before releasing
