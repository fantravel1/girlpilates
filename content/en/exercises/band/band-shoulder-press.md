## Starting Position
Stand on the center of the resistance band with feet hip-width apart. Hold one end in each hand at shoulder height, elbows bent at 90 degrees, palms facing forward. Engage your core and maintain neutral spine alignment.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, lengthening through your spine
2. Exhale as you press both arms straight up toward the ceiling, fully extending your elbows
3. Keep your ribcage stable and avoid arching your back
4. Inhale as you slowly bend your elbows, lowering your hands back to shoulder height
5. Repeat for 10-12 repetitions

## Breathing
Exhale during the upward press. Inhale as you lower your arms with control.

## Tips
- Maintain strong core engagement to protect your lower back
- Press evenly with both arms to avoid twisting through your torso
- Keep your wrists straight and strong throughout
- Avoid shrugging your shoulders toward your ears

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use lighter resistance band or reduce the range of motion
- **Harder:** Use heavier resistance band or perform the exercise standing on one leg for added balance challenge
