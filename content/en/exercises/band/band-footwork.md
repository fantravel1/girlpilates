## Starting Position
Lie on your back with knees bent into your chest. Loop the resistance band around the balls of your feet and hold one end in each hand near your hips. Position your feet together in Pilates first position (heels together, toes slightly apart).

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, engaging your core and maintaining neutral spine
2. Exhale as you press both legs away to a 45-degree angle, straightening your knees
3. Keep your feet in first position with heels connected
4. Inhale as you bend your knees, bringing them back toward your chest with control
5. Repeat for 10-12 repetitions
6. Optional: Repeat with feet in parallel position and then with heels on the band

## Breathing
Exhale as you press your legs away. Inhale as you draw your knees back in.

## Tips
- Keep your lower back pressed gently into the mat throughout
- Maintain even pressure through both feet
- Keep your pelvis stable - avoid rocking side to side
- Engage your inner thighs to maintain proper foot position

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use lighter resistance band or reduce the range of motion
- **Harder:** Use heavier resistance band or add ankle weights for increased resistance
