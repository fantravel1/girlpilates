## Starting Position
Lie on your back with knees bent into your chest. Loop the resistance band around the balls of your feet and hold one end in each hand near your hips. Your shins should be parallel to the floor with knees bent at 90 degrees.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, engaging your core and keeping your lower back connected to the mat
2. Exhale as you press both feet away, straightening your legs at a 45-degree angle
3. Maintain stable pelvis and avoid arching your lower back
4. Inhale as you slowly bend your knees, returning your legs to the starting position
5. Repeat for 12-15 repetitions

## Breathing
Exhale as you press your legs away. Inhale as you draw your knees back in with control.

## Tips
- Keep your lower back pressed into the mat throughout the movement
- Maintain even pressure through both feet
- Press through your heels rather than your toes
- Keep your neck relaxed and shoulders away from your ears

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use lighter resistance band or reduce the range of motion by not extending legs fully
- **Harder:** Use heavier resistance band or perform single leg presses alternating sides
