## Starting Position
Stand sideways to a fixed point where you've secured one end of the resistance band at waist height. Hold the other end with your outside hand, elbow bent at 90 degrees and tucked against your side, forearm across your belly with palm facing down.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, standing tall with core engaged
2. Exhale as you rotate your forearm away from your body, pulling the band across your torso
3. Keep your elbow stable and pressed against your side throughout
4. Inhale as you slowly return your hand to the starting position with control
5. Complete 12-15 repetitions, then switch sides

## Breathing
Exhale as you rotate inward across your body. Inhale as you return to the starting position.

## Tips
- Keep your elbow glued to your side - it should remain stationary
- Avoid rotating your torso - the movement comes only from your shoulder
- Move with control and avoid using momentum
- Maintain proper posture with shoulders back and down

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use lighter resistance band or reduce the range of motion
- **Harder:** Use heavier resistance band or slow down the tempo significantly
