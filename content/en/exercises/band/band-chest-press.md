## Starting Position
Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the mat. Thread the resistance band under your upper back at chest level. Hold one end of the band in each hand, elbows bent at 90 degrees with hands by your shoulders, palms facing toward your feet.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, engaging your core and maintaining neutral spine
2. Exhale as you press both arms straight up toward the ceiling, extending your elbows
3. Keep your shoulder blades stable on the mat and maintain the natural curve of your neck
4. Inhale as you slowly bend your elbows, lowering your hands back to shoulder height
5. Repeat for 12-15 repetitions

## Breathing
Exhale during the press as you extend your arms. Inhale as you lower with control.

## Tips
- Keep your wrists straight and aligned with your forearms
- Maintain steady contact between your ribcage and the mat - avoid arching
- Press evenly with both arms to maintain balance
- Focus on smooth, controlled movement throughout the entire range

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use lighter resistance band or reduce the range of motion
- **Harder:** Use heavier resistance band or add a pause at the top of the movement
