## Starting Position
Stand tall with feet hip-width apart. Hold the resistance band with both hands wider than shoulder-width apart, arms extended down in front of your thighs. Create slight tension in the band. Engage your core and maintain neutral spine alignment.

## Execution
1. Inhale as you raise your arms forward and up, bringing the band overhead
2. Continue the circular motion backward and down, keeping your arms straight
3. Exhale as you complete the full circle, returning to the starting position
4. Maintain steady tension in the band throughout the entire circle
5. Complete 8-10 circles forward, then reverse direction for 8-10 circles backward

## Breathing
Inhale during the upward phase of the circle. Exhale during the downward phase.

## Tips
- Keep your arms straight throughout the entire movement
- Maintain steady, even circles without jerking or rushing
- Engage your core to prevent arching your lower back as arms go overhead
- Keep your shoulders down and away from your ears

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use lighter resistance band or widen your hand position to reduce tension
- **Harder:** Use heavier resistance band or slow down the tempo significantly
