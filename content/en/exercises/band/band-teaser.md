## Starting Position
Sit on your mat with knees bent and feet flat. Loop the resistance band around the balls of your feet and hold one end in each hand. Lean back slightly to create tension in the band. Engage your core and lengthen through your spine.

## Execution
1. Inhale as you extend your legs to a 45-degree angle and simultaneously roll your spine down to the mat
2. Keep the band tension steady as you lower with control
3. Exhale as you curl your upper body back up while maintaining your leg position
4. Reach your arms forward parallel to your legs, creating a V-shape with your body
5. Inhale to hold the teaser position
6. Repeat for 6-8 repetitions

## Breathing
Inhale as you roll down. Exhale as you curl back up to the teaser position.

## Tips
- Keep your legs absolutely still at 45 degrees throughout the movement
- Maintain steady band tension by keeping your feet flexed
- Use your core to control the movement, not momentum
- Keep your chest lifted and shoulders back in the teaser position

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Keep knees bent throughout or hold onto your thighs for support
- **Harder:** Lower your legs closer to the floor or hold the teaser position for 5-10 seconds
