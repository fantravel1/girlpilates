## Starting Position
Stand tall with feet hip-width apart or sit on a chair. Hold the resistance band overhead with both hands, arms extended, hands wider than shoulder-width apart. Create slight tension in the band.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, engaging your core and lengthening your spine
2. Exhale as you pull the band apart and down toward your chest, bending your elbows wide
3. Draw your shoulder blades down and together as the band reaches chest level
4. Inhale as you slowly extend your arms back overhead, maintaining tension
5. Repeat for 10-12 repetitions

## Breathing
Exhale as you pull the band down toward your chest. Inhale as you extend back to the starting position.

## Tips
- Keep your chest lifted and avoid arching your lower back
- Lead with your elbows, pulling them down and back
- Maintain steady tension in the band throughout the movement
- Keep your neck long and shoulders away from your ears

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use lighter resistance band or narrow your hand position to reduce tension
- **Harder:** Use heavier resistance band or perform the exercise in a slight squat position
