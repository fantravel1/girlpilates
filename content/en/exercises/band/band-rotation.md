## Starting Position
Stand tall with feet hip-width apart. Secure one end of the resistance band to a fixed point at chest height. Hold the other end with both hands, arms extended in front of your chest. Step away to create tension in the band. Position yourself sideways to the anchor point.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, engaging your core and maintaining tall posture
2. Exhale as you rotate your torso away from the anchor point, pulling the band across your body
3. Keep your arms straight and move from your core, not your arms
4. Inhale as you slowly rotate back to the starting position with control
5. Complete 10-12 repetitions, then switch sides

## Breathing
Exhale as you rotate away from the anchor. Inhale as you return to center.

## Tips
- Keep your hips stable and facing forward - only your torso rotates
- Maintain tall spine throughout - avoid collapsing or hunching
- Move with control and avoid using momentum
- Keep your shoulders down and away from your ears

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use lighter resistance band or reduce the range of rotation
- **Harder:** Use heavier resistance band or perform the exercise in a slight squat position
