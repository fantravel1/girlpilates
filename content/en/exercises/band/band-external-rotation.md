## Starting Position
Stand tall with feet hip-width apart. Hold the resistance band with both hands at waist level, elbows bent at 90 degrees and tucked close to your sides. Position your forearms parallel to the floor with palms facing up, creating slight tension in the band.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, engaging your core and maintaining stable posture
2. Exhale as you rotate your forearms outward, moving your hands away from each other
3. Keep your elbows glued to your sides throughout the movement
4. Inhale as you slowly return your hands to the starting position with control
5. Repeat for 12-15 repetitions

## Breathing
Exhale as you rotate outward. Inhale as you return to center with control.

## Tips
- Keep your elbows pinned to your sides - they should not move
- Maintain neutral wrist alignment throughout
- Move slowly and with control - this is a small, precise movement
- Keep your shoulders relaxed and down away from your ears

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use lighter resistance band or reduce the range of motion
- **Harder:** Use heavier resistance band or hold the rotated position for 2-3 seconds before returning
