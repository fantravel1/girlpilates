## Starting Position
Stand tall with the resistance band looped around your legs just above your ankles or knees. Position your feet hip-width apart to create tension in the band. Soften your knees slightly and engage your core, maintaining neutral spine alignment.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, maintaining tension in the band
2. Exhale as you step your right foot out to the side, keeping constant tension
3. Inhale as you follow with your left foot, returning to hip-width stance
4. Continue stepping sideways for 10-12 steps to the right
5. Reverse direction and walk 10-12 steps to the left
6. Repeat the sequence for 2-3 sets

## Breathing
Exhale with each step. Inhale as you prepare for the next step.

## Tips
- Maintain constant tension in the band - don't let your feet come too close together
- Keep your knees tracking over your toes, not collapsing inward
- Stay low in a slight squat position throughout the walk
- Keep your upper body stable and avoid swaying side to side

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use lighter resistance band or take smaller steps
- **Harder:** Use heavier resistance band or lower into a deeper squat position while walking
