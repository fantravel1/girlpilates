## Starting Position
Stand tall with feet hip-width apart. Hold one end of the band in your right hand and bring it behind your head, elbow bent and pointing toward the ceiling. Reach your left hand behind your lower back to hold the other end of the band, creating tension.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, stabilizing your core and maintaining neutral spine
2. Exhale as you straighten your right elbow, extending your arm toward the ceiling
3. Keep your upper arm stable - only your forearm should move
4. Inhale as you slowly bend your elbow, returning to the starting position
5. Complete 10-12 repetitions, then switch arms

## Breathing
Exhale as you extend and straighten the arm. Inhale as you return to the bent position with control.

## Tips
- Keep your elbow pointing forward, not letting it flare out to the side
- Maintain length in your neck and keep your shoulders relaxed
- Engage your abdominals to prevent arching your lower back
- Move with smooth, controlled tempo throughout

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use lighter resistance band or adjust hand positions to reduce tension
- **Harder:** Use heavier resistance band or perform the exercise more slowly to increase time under tension
