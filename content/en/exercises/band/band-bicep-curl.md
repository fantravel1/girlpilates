## Starting Position
Sit tall on your mat with legs extended forward, spine elongated. Place the center of the resistance band under your feet and hold one end in each hand with palms facing up. Arms are extended down by your sides with slight tension in the band.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, engaging your core and maintaining tall posture
2. Exhale as you bend your elbows, curling your hands toward your shoulders
3. Keep your elbows stable by your sides, moving only your forearms
4. Inhale as you slowly lower your hands back to the starting position with control
5. Repeat for 10-15 repetitions

## Breathing
Exhale during the curl up phase when the muscle contracts. Inhale as you lengthen and lower with control.

## Tips
- Keep your shoulders down and back throughout the movement
- Maintain stable elbows - avoid letting them drift forward or backward
- Focus on controlled movement rather than speed
- Keep your core engaged to prevent arching your lower back

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use lighter resistance band or create less tension by loosening your grip on the band
- **Harder:** Use heavier resistance band or increase tension by shortening the band length
