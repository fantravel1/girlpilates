## Starting Position
Sit tall on your mat with legs extended wide in a V-shape. Loop the resistance band around your feet and hold one end in each hand. Extend your arms out to the sides at shoulder height, creating tension in the band. Sit up tall with core engaged.

## Execution
1. Inhale as you rotate your torso to the right, keeping your arms extended
2. Exhale as you reach your left hand toward your right foot in a sawing motion
3. Keep your right arm reaching back behind you as you rotate and flex forward
4. Inhale as you roll back up to sitting tall, maintaining the rotation
5. Exhale as you return to center with arms extended to the sides
6. Repeat on the left side, alternating for 6-8 repetitions per side

## Breathing
Inhale to rotate. Exhale to reach forward in the sawing motion. Inhale to return to upright. Exhale to center.

## Tips
- Keep both sitting bones planted firmly on the mat throughout
- Rotate from your waist, not just your arms
- Reach the back arm away as you saw forward with the front arm
- Maintain tall spine even as you flex forward - avoid collapsing

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use lighter resistance band or reduce the forward reach
- **Harder:** Use heavier resistance band or hold the rotated position for 2-3 seconds before returning
