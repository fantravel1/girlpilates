## Starting Position
Lie on your side with the Pilates ball positioned under your waist and hip. Extend your bottom arm on the mat for support and place your top hand in front of you for balance. Stack your legs with feet flexed.

## Execution
1. Engage your core to stabilize yourself on the ball and maintain alignment.
2. Exhale as you lift your top leg toward the ceiling, keeping it straight and in line with your body.
3. Lift only to hip height, avoiding the tendency to roll forward or back on the ball.
4. Inhale as you lower your leg back to meet the bottom leg with control.

## Breathing
Exhale as you lift the leg. Inhale as you lower. Maintain steady breathing throughout the set.

## Tips
- Keep your body in one straight line; avoid bending at the waist or rolling on the ball
- Lift from your hip, not by tilting your pelvis or leaning back
- Engage your obliques to maintain stability and prevent rolling

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Place the ball under your ribcage instead of your waist for better stability
- **Harder:** Add small circles at the top of the lift, or hold the lifted position for 5-10 seconds
