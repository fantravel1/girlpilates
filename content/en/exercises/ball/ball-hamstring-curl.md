## Starting Position
Lie on your back with arms by your sides, palms down. Place both heels on top of the Pilates ball with legs extended. Lift your hips into a bridge position, creating a straight line from shoulders to heels.

## Execution
1. Maintain the bridge position with hips lifted throughout the entire exercise.
2. Exhale as you bend your knees and pull the ball toward your glutes using your hamstrings and feet.
3. Keep your hips level and lifted as the ball rolls toward you.
4. Inhale as you slowly extend your legs, rolling the ball back to the starting position.

## Breathing
Exhale as you curl the ball in. Inhale as you extend the ball away. Maintain rhythmic breathing.

## Tips
- Keep your hips lifted and stable throughout; avoid dropping them as you curl
- Press down through your shoulders and arms to help stabilize your upper body
- Control the ball on both the curl and the extension phases

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Lower your hips to the mat between reps, making it less of an isometric hold
- **Harder:** Perform single-leg curls, extending one leg to the ceiling while the other works
