## Starting Position
Lie on your back with knees bent at 90 degrees, shins parallel to the floor. Place the small Pilates ball between your right hand and right knee, pressing them together to hold the ball in place. Extend your left arm overhead and left leg long, hovering just above the mat.

## Execution
1. Maintain pressure on the ball while keeping your lower back pressed into the mat
2. Slowly switch sides by extending your right arm and leg while bringing the ball to your left hand and knee
3. Transfer the ball smoothly between opposite hand and knee combinations
4. Continue alternating sides with control, maintaining core engagement throughout

## Breathing
Exhale as you extend the arm and leg. Inhale as you switch the ball to the opposite side.

## Tips
- Keep your lower back flat against the mat throughout the movement
- Move slowly and with control to maintain balance and ball placement
- Focus on opposite arm-leg coordination patterns

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Keep the extended leg higher or bend the knee slightly
- **Harder:** Extend both arms and legs simultaneously while balancing the ball on your shins
