## Starting Position
Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Place the small Pilates ball between your knees, squeezing gently to hold it in place. Extend your arms out to the sides at shoulder height, palms down.

## Execution
1. Keeping knees together with the ball, slowly lower both legs to the right side
2. Keep your shoulders anchored to the mat as your spine rotates
3. Return to center with control, then lower legs to the left side
4. Continue alternating sides with smooth, deliberate movements

## Breathing
Exhale as you rotate to the side. Inhale as you return to center.

## Tips
- Move slowly to feel the stretch and rotation through your spine
- Keep shoulders grounded; only your lower body should rotate
- The ball helps keep your legs aligned and engaged

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Reduce the range of motion, only rotating partway to each side
- **Harder:** Lift legs to tabletop position and rotate from there
