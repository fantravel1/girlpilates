## Starting Position
Kneel on the mat with a stability ball in front of you. Step your right foot forward into a lunge position with your knee bent at 90 degrees. Place both hands on top of the ball for support, keeping your left knee on the mat behind you.

## Execution
1. Gently press your hips forward while maintaining an upright torso
2. Feel the stretch in the front of your left hip and thigh
3. You can slightly roll the ball forward to deepen the stretch
4. Hold for several breaths, then switch to stretch the opposite hip

## Breathing
Breathe deeply and steadily, using exhales to relax deeper into the stretch.

## Tips
- Keep your front knee aligned over your ankle, not past your toes
- Engage your core to protect your lower back
- The ball provides support while allowing you to control the depth

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Keep the ball closer and maintain a more upright position
- **Harder:** Lift your back knee off the mat for a more intense hip flexor stretch
