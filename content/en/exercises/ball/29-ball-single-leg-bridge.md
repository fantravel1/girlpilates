## Starting Position
Lie on your back with your right heel on top of a stability ball, leg extended. Your left leg is bent with foot flat on the floor. Arms rest by your sides, palms down. Engage your core and glutes to prepare.

## Execution
1. Press through your right heel into the ball and lift your hips off the mat into a bridge
2. The ball may roll slightly; use your hamstring and glute to control it
3. Extend your left leg up toward the ceiling while maintaining the bridge position
4. Lower your hips with control, then repeat before switching legs

## Breathing
Exhale as you lift into bridge. Inhale as you lower back down.

## Tips
- Keep your hips level; don't let one side drop lower than the other
- Press firmly through the heel on the ball to engage your posterior chain
- The ball adds instability, so move slowly and with control

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Keep both feet on the ball and perform a standard bridge
- **Harder:** Add a hamstring curl by bending the knee to roll the ball toward you at the top
