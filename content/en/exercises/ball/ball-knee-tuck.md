## Starting Position
Start in a plank position with hands on the mat directly under shoulders and shins resting on top of the Pilates ball. Engage your core deeply and maintain a straight line from head to heels.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, maintaining a strong plank position.
2. Exhale as you bend your knees and pull them toward your chest, rolling the ball forward with your shins.
3. Keep your core deeply engaged and your back slightly rounded at the top of the tuck.
4. Inhale as you extend your legs back to the plank position, rolling the ball back with control.

## Breathing
Exhale as you tuck your knees in. Inhale as you extend back to plank. Maintain rhythmic breathing.

## Tips
- Keep your shoulders stable over your wrists; avoid shifting forward or back
- Pull your knees in using your core muscles, not just your hip flexors
- Control the ball on both the tuck and the extension to maximize core engagement

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Perform smaller tucks, bringing knees only partway toward chest initially
- **Harder:** Add a push-up at the bottom of each rep, or perform the tuck with straight legs (pike)
