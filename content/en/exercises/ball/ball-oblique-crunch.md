## Starting Position
Lie sideways over the Pilates ball with your hip on the ball and feet staggered against a wall for stability. Place your bottom hand on the mat for support and your top hand behind your head. Your body should be in a straight line.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, engaging your core and stabilizing on the ball.
2. Exhale as you lift your upper body laterally, creating a side crunch through your obliques.
3. Reach your ribs toward your hip on the working side, feeling the contraction along your waist.
4. Inhale as you slowly lower back to the starting position, maintaining control.

## Breathing
Exhale as you crunch up. Inhale as you lower down. Keep breathing steady throughout the set.

## Tips
- Move purely in the lateral plane; avoid rotating forward or backward
- Keep your neck aligned with your spine; don't pull on your head
- Focus on the quality of the contraction rather than range of motion

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Keep both hands on the mat for better stability and support
- **Harder:** Extend both arms overhead or hold a light weight in your top hand
