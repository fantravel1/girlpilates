## Starting Position
Sit on the floor in front of a stability ball. Slowly walk your feet forward as you recline back over the ball, allowing it to support your spine. Position the ball under your mid to upper back with your head and shoulders draped back over it.

## Execution
1. Extend your arms overhead or out to the sides, opening across your chest
2. Allow gravity to gently stretch your chest, shoulders, and front body
3. Relax into the ball, letting it support your weight completely
4. Hold this restorative position for several deep breaths

## Breathing
Breathe deeply and slowly, allowing your ribcage to expand fully with each inhale.

## Tips
- Keep your feet firmly planted and knees bent for stability
- Let your head relax back, but avoid excessive neck extension
- Focus on the opening sensation across your chest and shoulders

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use a larger ball for gentler extension or keep hands on the floor
- **Harder:** Walk feet further away to increase the back extension and chest opening
