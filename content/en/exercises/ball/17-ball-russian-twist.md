## Starting Position
Sit on the mat with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Hold the Pilates ball at chest level with both hands, arms extended. Lean back slightly to engage your core, maintaining a long spine and lifted chest.

## Execution
1. Engage your core and rotate your torso to the right, bringing the ball toward the floor beside your hip
2. Pause briefly, then rotate through center to the left side
3. Keep your hips stable and facing forward while only your upper body rotates
4. Continue alternating sides with smooth, controlled movements

## Breathing
Exhale as you rotate to each side. Inhale as you pass through center.

## Tips
- Keep your shoulders down and away from your ears
- Maintain length in your spine rather than rounding forward
- Move from your waist, not just your arms

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Keep feet on the floor for more stability
- **Harder:** Lift feet off the floor and hover in a V-position while rotating
