## Starting Position
Lie on your back with arms by your sides, palms down. Place both heels on top of the Pilates ball with legs extended. Engage your core and maintain a neutral spine.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, then exhale as you lift your hips off the mat, creating a straight line from shoulders to heels.
2. Press down through your heels into the ball to activate your glutes and hamstrings while maintaining ball stability.
3. Hold the bridge position for 3-5 breaths, keeping your core engaged and hips level.
4. Inhale and slowly lower your hips back to the mat with control.

## Breathing
Exhale as you lift into the bridge. Breathe naturally while holding the position. Inhale as you lower down.

## Tips
- Keep the ball stable by engaging your inner thighs and pressing evenly through both heels
- Avoid arching your lower back; maintain a neutral pelvis throughout
- Focus on lifting from the glutes rather than pushing with your lower back

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Place the ball closer to your body (under calves instead of heels) for more stability
- **Harder:** Lift one leg off the ball and extend it to the ceiling, performing single-leg bridges
