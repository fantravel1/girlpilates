## Starting Position
Lie on your back with arms extended out to the sides at shoulder height for stability. Lift your legs and place the small Pilates ball between your ankles or feet, squeezing to hold it securely. Extend your legs toward the ceiling.

## Execution
1. Keeping your legs together with the ball, slowly lower them to the right side in a pendulum motion
2. Keep your shoulders anchored to the mat as your legs swing to the side
3. Use your obliques to pull your legs back to center, then swing to the left side
4. Continue alternating sides with controlled, pendulum-like movements

## Breathing
Exhale as you lower legs to the side. Inhale as you return to center.

## Tips
- Keep the movement controlled; don't let gravity drop your legs
- Maintain constant squeeze on the ball throughout the exercise
- Start with small swings and gradually increase range as you build control

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Bend your knees slightly or reduce the range of motion
- **Harder:** Lower legs closer to the floor before swinging side to side
