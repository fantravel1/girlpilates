## Starting Position
Start in a plank position with hands on the mat directly under shoulders and shins resting on top of the Pilates ball. Engage your core and maintain a straight line from head to heels.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, engaging your core deeply.
2. Exhale as you lift your hips toward the ceiling, rolling the ball toward your hands until it reaches your ankles or feet.
3. At the top of the pike, your body should form an inverted V shape with straight legs.
4. Inhale as you slowly roll the ball back to the starting plank position with control.

## Breathing
Exhale as you pike up. Inhale as you return to plank. Maintain steady breathing throughout.

## Tips
- Keep your legs straight throughout the movement to fully engage your core
- Press firmly through your hands and shoulders to maintain stability
- Move slowly and with control; this is about quality, not speed

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Perform knee tucks instead, bringing knees toward chest without lifting hips as high
- **Harder:** Add a push-up at the bottom of each rep before piking
