## Starting Position
Lie prone (face down) over the Pilates ball with the ball positioned under your hips and lower abdomen. Place your feet hip-width apart on the mat for stability. Let your upper body drape over the ball with hands behind your head or crossed at your chest.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, engaging your core to support your lower back.
2. Exhale as you lift your chest away from the ball, extending through your spine to create a gentle arch.
3. Reach the crown of your head forward and up, keeping your neck in line with your spine.
4. Inhale as you slowly lower back to the starting position with control.

## Breathing
Exhale as you extend up. Inhale as you lower down. Use your breath to guide the movement.

## Tips
- Focus on lengthening your spine rather than just lifting high
- Keep your glutes engaged to protect your lower back
- Avoid hyperextending; create a gentle, natural curve through your entire spine

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Place hands on the mat in front of you for added support and balance
- **Harder:** Extend arms overhead in a "Y" position to increase the challenge
