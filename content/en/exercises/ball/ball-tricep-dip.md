## Starting Position
Sit on the Pilates ball with hands placed on the ball beside your hips, fingers pointing forward. Walk your feet forward and shift your hips off the ball so your body weight is supported by your hands and feet. Keep your knees bent and feet flat on the mat.

## Execution
1. Inhale as you bend your elbows to lower your hips toward the floor, keeping elbows pointing straight back.
2. Lower until your elbows reach approximately 90 degrees, maintaining control of the ball.
3. Exhale as you press through your palms to straighten your arms and return to the starting position.
4. Keep your core engaged and body close to the ball throughout the movement.

## Breathing
Inhale as you lower down. Exhale as you press back up. Breathe steadily throughout.

## Tips
- Keep your elbows pointing back, not flaring out to the sides
- Maintain proximity to the ball; don't walk your feet too far forward
- Engage your core to prevent the ball from rolling away

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Keep your feet closer to the ball and knees more bent for better support
- **Harder:** Extend your legs further from the ball or lift one leg off the ground
