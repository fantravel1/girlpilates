## Starting Position
Stand with your back to a wall and place the Pilates ball between your lower back and the wall. Step your feet forward about 12 inches from the wall, hip-width apart. Engage your core and stand tall.

## Execution
1. Inhale as you slowly bend your knees and lower into a squat, rolling the ball down the wall with your back.
2. Lower until your thighs are parallel to the floor (or as far as comfortable), keeping your knees aligned over your ankles.
3. Exhale as you press through your heels to straighten your legs and return to standing, rolling the ball back up.
4. Maintain constant contact between your back and the ball throughout the movement.

## Breathing
Inhale as you lower into the squat. Exhale as you press back up to standing.

## Tips
- Keep your weight in your heels and ensure your knees don't extend past your toes
- Maintain a neutral spine by keeping your core engaged and chest lifted
- Press evenly through both feet to maintain balance on the unstable ball

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Only lower partway down, working in a smaller range of motion
- **Harder:** Hold at the bottom of the squat for 10-30 seconds, or lift one leg off the ground for single-leg squats
