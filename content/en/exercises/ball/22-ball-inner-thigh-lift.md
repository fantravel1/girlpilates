## Starting Position
Lie on your right side with your body in a straight line. Bend your top (left) leg and place the foot flat on the floor in front of your bottom leg. Place the small Pilates ball between your bottom (right) inner thigh and the mat. Rest your head on your extended lower arm.

## Execution
1. Engage your inner thigh and press down into the ball
2. Lift your bottom leg slightly off the mat by squeezing the ball
3. Hold briefly at the top, feeling the inner thigh engagement
4. Lower with control and repeat before switching sides

## Breathing
Exhale as you press into and lift the ball. Inhale as you lower down.

## Tips
- Keep your hips stacked and avoid rolling forward or back
- Focus on the squeeze rather than how high you lift
- Maintain core engagement for stability

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Simply press into the ball without lifting the leg
- **Harder:** Add small pulses at the top of the lift before lowering
