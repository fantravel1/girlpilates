## Starting Position
Lie on your back with arms by your sides, palms down. Bend your knees at 90 degrees and place the small Pilates ball between your knees, squeezing gently to hold it in place. Shins should be parallel to the floor in tabletop position.

## Execution
1. Engage your lower abdominals and curl your hips off the mat, bringing knees toward your chest
2. Lift your tailbone and lower back off the mat while maintaining the ball squeeze
3. Slowly lower back to starting position with control
4. Repeat the movement, focusing on using your abs rather than momentum

## Breathing
Exhale as you curl your hips up. Inhale as you lower back down.

## Tips
- Use your abs to lift, not momentum from swinging your legs
- Keep consistent pressure on the ball throughout the exercise
- Avoid pressing down with your arms; let your core do the work

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Reduce the range of motion, lifting hips only slightly
- **Harder:** Extend legs to 45 degrees while maintaining ball squeeze between ankles
