## Starting Position
Kneel in front of the Pilates ball and place both hands on top of the ball, shoulder-width apart. Step your feet back into a plank position with legs extended, creating a straight line from head to heels.

## Execution
1. Engage your core deeply, drawing your navel to your spine while maintaining neutral alignment.
2. Press down through your hands to stabilize the ball while keeping your shoulders directly over your wrists.
3. Hold the position for 30-45 seconds, breathing steadily and making small adjustments to maintain balance.
4. Lower your knees to the mat to release when complete.

## Breathing
Breathe naturally and continuously throughout the hold. Use lateral breathing to maintain core engagement.

## Tips
- Keep your body in one straight line; avoid sagging hips or lifting your bottom too high
- Engage your leg muscles and squeeze your inner thighs to help stabilize
- If the ball rolls, make small corrections with your core rather than your arms

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Place your knees on the mat in a modified plank position
- **Harder:** Lift one leg off the ground and hold, alternating legs
