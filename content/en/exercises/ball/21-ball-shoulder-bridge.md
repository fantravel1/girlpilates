## Starting Position
Lie with your upper back and shoulders supported on the Pilates ball, knees bent at 90 degrees with feet flat on the floor hip-width apart. Your hips should be lifted in a bridge position, creating a straight line from shoulders to knees. Arms can extend out to sides for balance.

## Execution
1. Engage your glutes and core to maintain the bridge position on the ball
2. Slowly lower your hips toward the floor by bending at the hips
3. Press through your heels to lift back up to the starting bridge position
4. Repeat the lowering and lifting motion while maintaining balance on the ball

## Breathing
Inhale as you lower your hips. Exhale as you press up to bridge position.

## Tips
- Keep your core engaged to prevent the ball from rolling
- Press firmly through your heels to activate glutes and hamstrings
- Maintain neck in neutral alignment with your spine

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use a larger stability ball for more surface area and stability
- **Harder:** Lift one leg off the floor and perform single-leg bridges on the ball
