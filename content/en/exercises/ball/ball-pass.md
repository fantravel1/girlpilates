## Starting Position
Lie on your back with legs extended straight on the mat and arms extended overhead, holding the Pilates ball in your hands. Engage your core and press your lower back gently toward the mat.

## Execution
1. Inhale as you simultaneously lift your legs and upper body, bringing the ball and your feet toward each other.
2. Exhale as you pass the ball from your hands to between your ankles, squeezing the ball with your feet.
3. Inhale as you lower both your arms and legs back down toward the mat with control, keeping the core engaged.
4. Exhale as you lift again to pass the ball back from feet to hands, completing one full repetition.

## Breathing
Exhale during each pass (hands to feet or feet to hands). Inhale as you lower down between passes.

## Tips
- Keep your lower back connected to the mat throughout; don't let it arch up
- Move with control and precision rather than momentum
- If your neck strains, keep your head on the mat and focus on the leg movements

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Bend your knees slightly when lifting and lowering to reduce hip flexor strain
- **Harder:** Lower your arms and legs closer to the mat (without touching) between passes
