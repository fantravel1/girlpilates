## Starting Position
Sit on the Pilates ball and walk your feet forward until your upper back and shoulders are supported on the ball. Your knees should be bent at 90 degrees with feet flat on the mat. Hold light weights or hands in prayer position at chest level. Engage your core to maintain a neutral spine.

## Execution
1. Position your hands at chest level (with or without weights), elbows bent at 90 degrees.
2. Exhale as you press your hands straight up toward the ceiling, extending your arms fully.
3. Keep your hips lifted and core engaged throughout to maintain a stable bridge position on the ball.
4. Inhale as you slowly lower your hands back to the starting position with control.

## Breathing
Exhale as you press up. Inhale as you lower down. Maintain steady breathing to support core stability.

## Tips
- Keep your hips level and lifted throughout; don't let them sag
- Maintain balance on the ball by engaging your core and glutes
- Focus on controlled movement rather than speed or heavy weights

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Perform without weights, simply pressing palms together and extending arms
- **Harder:** Lower your hips slightly between reps to add an extra core challenge, or use heavier weights
