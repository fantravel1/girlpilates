## Starting Position
Kneel on the mat and drape your torso over the Pilates ball (larger stability ball works best), with the ball supporting your abdomen and hips. Place your hands on the floor in front of the ball and knees behind it, creating a stable four-point position.

## Execution
1. Round your spine upward into cat position, drawing your abdominals in and tucking your chin
2. The ball will roll slightly forward as you round your back
3. Arch your spine into cow position, lifting your chest and tailbone while the ball rolls back
4. Continue flowing between cat and cow positions with smooth transitions

## Breathing
Exhale as you round into cat position. Inhale as you arch into cow position.

## Tips
- Let the ball move naturally with your body; don't fight against it
- Focus on articulating through each vertebra of your spine
- Keep your shoulders relaxed and away from your ears

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use a larger ball for more support and stability
- **Harder:** Lift one hand off the floor during each position for added balance challenge
