## Starting Position
Sit on the mat in a mermaid position with both legs bent to one side. Place the Pilates ball on the floor next to your hip on the opposite side. Rest one hand on top of the ball for support.

## Execution
1. Gently roll the ball away from your body as you side bend over it
2. Extend your opposite arm overhead, reaching toward the ball to deepen the stretch
3. Feel the lengthening along the entire side of your body from hip to fingertips
4. Hold the stretch for several breaths, then slowly return to center and switch sides

## Breathing
Inhale to prepare and lengthen your spine. Exhale as you side bend over the ball.

## Tips
- Keep both sit bones grounded on the mat
- Reach up and over rather than collapsing into the stretch
- Allow the ball to support you as you find the stretch

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Keep the ball closer and don't roll it as far away
- **Harder:** Lift the bottom hip slightly off the mat for a deeper oblique stretch
