## Starting Position
Kneel on the mat with the Pilates ball in front of you. Place your forearms on top of the ball with hands clasped together. Engage your core and maintain a neutral spine.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, then exhale as you slowly roll the ball forward, extending your arms and lengthening your body.
2. Continue rolling until your body forms a long diagonal line from knees to head, keeping your core deeply engaged.
3. Pause briefly at full extension, maintaining control and stability.
4. Exhale as you pull the ball back toward your knees, using your core muscles to initiate the return.

## Breathing
Exhale as you roll out. Inhale at the extended position. Exhale as you return to start.

## Tips
- Lead with your core, not your shoulders; think of pulling your navel to spine throughout
- Keep your back flat and avoid sagging through your lower back at full extension
- Roll only as far as you can maintain proper form and control

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Limit the range of motion, rolling out only halfway initially
- **Harder:** Perform from a plank position with feet on the ground instead of kneeling
