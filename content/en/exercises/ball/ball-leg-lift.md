## Starting Position
Lie on your back with arms by your sides, palms down. Place the Pilates ball between your ankles and squeeze gently to hold it in place. Extend your legs toward the ceiling, perpendicular to the mat. Engage your core.

## Execution
1. Inhale as you slowly lower your legs toward the mat, keeping them straight and the ball secure.
2. Lower only as far as you can while maintaining a neutral spine and keeping your lower back on the mat.
3. Exhale as you lift your legs back to the starting position, using your lower abdominals to initiate the movement.
4. Keep constant tension on the ball by squeezing it between your ankles throughout.

## Breathing
Inhale as you lower the legs. Exhale as you lift them back up. Maintain steady breathing.

## Tips
- Press your lower back into the mat throughout; if it arches, you've lowered too far
- Squeeze the ball consistently to engage your inner thighs and help stabilize your pelvis
- Move slowly and with control; avoid using momentum

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Bend your knees slightly or reduce the range of motion
- **Harder:** Lower your legs closer to the mat (without touching) while maintaining form
