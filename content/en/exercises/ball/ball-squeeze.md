## Starting Position
Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the mat, hip-width apart. Place the Pilates ball between your knees. Rest your arms by your sides with palms down. Maintain a neutral spine.

## Execution
1. Inhale to prepare, engaging your core and pelvic floor.
2. Exhale as you squeeze the ball firmly between your knees, feeling your inner thighs engage.
3. Hold the squeeze for 3-5 seconds while maintaining steady breathing.
4. Inhale as you release the pressure slightly, but keep the ball in place without letting it drop.

## Breathing
Exhale on the squeeze. Inhale on the release. Maintain a rhythmic pattern throughout.

## Tips
- Engage from your inner thighs rather than gripping with your knees
- Keep your shoulders relaxed and away from your ears
- Maintain neutral spine position; avoid tucking or arching your pelvis

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Use a softer, larger ball that requires less force to compress
- **Harder:** Lift your feet off the mat into tabletop position while squeezing, adding core challenge
