## Stability Ball Pilates Exercises

The stability ball (also called Swiss ball or exercise ball) is one of the most versatile pieces of Pilates equipment. Its unstable surface challenges your core, improves balance, and adds variety to your practice.

### Why Use a Stability Ball?

- **Core Activation**: The unstable surface forces constant core engagement
- **Balance Training**: Develops proprioception and body awareness
- **Flexibility**: Great for stretching and spinal mobility
- **Accessibility**: Inexpensive and easy to use at home
- **Variety**: Adds new dimensions to classic exercises

### Choosing Your Ball Size

| Your Height | Ball Size |
|-------------|-----------|
| Under 5'0" (152cm) | 45cm |
| 5'0" - 5'5" (152-165cm) | 55cm |
| 5'6" - 5'11" (168-180cm) | 65cm |
| 6'0"+ (183cm+) | 75cm |

When seated on the ball, your hips and knees should be at approximately 90 degrees.

### Exercise Categories

**Core & Abdominals**
Bridges, crunches, pikes, and planks that challenge your stability.

**Back & Spine**
Extensions, rotations, and stretches for spinal health.

**Lower Body**
Squats, bridges, and leg work with added instability.

**Upper Body**
Push-ups, dips, and chest work on the unstable surface.

**Stretching & Mobility**
Use the ball for deep stretches and spinal release.

### Safety Tips

1. **Inflate properly** - Ball should have slight give when pressed
2. **Use on a non-slip surface** - Avoid slippery floors
3. **Start with support** - Use a wall or chair when learning
4. **Progress gradually** - Master stability before adding complexity
5. **Check for damage** - Inspect ball regularly for wear
