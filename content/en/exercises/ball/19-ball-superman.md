## Starting Position
Lie face down over the Pilates ball with your hips centered on the ball. Place your hands and feet on the floor for stability, body in a neutral position. Engage your core to maintain balance.

## Execution
1. Simultaneously extend your right arm forward and left leg back, lifting both off the floor
2. Hold the extended position while balancing on the ball, keeping your body stable
3. Lower with control and switch to extend left arm and right leg
4. Continue alternating opposite arm and leg combinations

## Breathing
Exhale as you extend arm and leg. Inhale as you lower and prepare to switch.

## Tips
- Keep your neck in line with your spine, avoiding excessive tilting
- Engage your glutes and back muscles to maintain the extension
- Focus on length rather than height in your limbs

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Lift only one limb at a time (arm or leg separately)
- **Harder:** Extend both arms and both legs simultaneously, balancing only on your hips
