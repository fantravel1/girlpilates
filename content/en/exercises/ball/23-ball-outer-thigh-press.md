## Starting Position
Sit tall on the mat with legs extended in front of you. Bend your knees and place the small Pilates ball between your outer thighs, just above the knees. Place your hands behind you on the mat for support, keeping your chest lifted.

## Execution
1. Press your thighs outward against the ball, engaging your outer hip muscles
2. Hold the pressure for 2-3 seconds while maintaining upright posture
3. Release the pressure slightly without letting the ball fall
4. Repeat the pressing action, focusing on outer thigh and glute engagement

## Breathing
Exhale as you press outward against the ball. Inhale as you release the pressure.

## Tips
- Keep your spine long and chest lifted throughout
- Avoid letting your knees collapse inward between presses
- Focus on the outer hip muscles rather than just pushing with your knees

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Lean back slightly on your hands for more support
- **Harder:** Perform while in a slight bridge position with shoulders on the mat
