## Starting Position
Lie on your back with the small Pilates ball placed under your sacrum (lower back/tailbone area). Bend your knees and lift your legs to tabletop position with shins parallel to the floor. Rest your arms by your sides for support.

## Execution
1. Keeping knees together, slowly circle both legs in a small clockwise motion
2. Maintain stability in your pelvis and core while the ball supports your lower back
3. Complete 5 circles, then reverse direction for counterclockwise circles
4. Focus on smooth, controlled circular movements without rocking side to side

## Breathing
Exhale as you circle down and to the side. Inhale as you circle up and around.

## Tips
- Keep circles small and controlled to maintain stability
- Engage your deep core muscles to protect your lower back
- The ball should remain still; movement comes from your legs only

## Modifications
- **Easier:** Make smaller circles or practice the motion without the ball first
- **Harder:** Extend legs slightly away from your body while circling
