## The Academic Approach to Pilates

Rael Isacowitz is the founder of Body Arts and Science International (BASI) Pilates, one of the most academically rigorous Pilates education programs in the world. His approach combines deep respect for classical work with scientific understanding and clear educational methodology.

## Background

Born in South Africa, Rael was a competitive athlete (gymnastics, diving, swimming) before discovering his passion for movement arts. He holds a Master's degree in Dance from the University of Surrey and has studied with numerous first-generation Pilates teachers.

### The Block System

Exercises are organized into logical blocks based on:
- Body position
- Movement pattern
- Equipment

This systematic approach makes learning and teaching more efficient and ensures comprehensive coverage of the Pilates repertoire.

## Teaching Philosophy

> "Pilates is a science and an art. We must honor both. We must understand why we do what we do, and we must do it beautifully."

Rael emphasizes:
- **Understanding over imitation** - Know why each exercise works
- **Individual adaptation** - Modify for each body
- **Continuous learning** - Never stop studying
- **Excellence in execution** - Quality matters
