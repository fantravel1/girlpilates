## A Living Legend

Lolita San Miguel holds a unique place in Pilates history: she is one of only two people ever certified to teach by Joseph Pilates himself, and the last living person to have received this honor. Her direct connection to the founder makes her an invaluable link to Pilates' origins.

## The Historic Certification

In 1967, just months before his death, Joseph Pilates certified only two teachers in his entire career:

1. **Lolita San Miguel**
2. **Romana Kryzanowska** (who passed away in 2013)

This makes Lolita the last living direct lineage holder from Joseph Pilates himself.

## Background

Born in Puerto Rico, Lolita was a professional ballet dancer who discovered Pilates when seeking help for dance injuries. She was introduced to Joseph and Clara Pilates and became devoted to the method.

Her dance background gave her deep understanding of:
- Body alignment and positioning
- The artistic elements of movement
- Working with performers
- The demands of professional dance

## The Journey

After her certification, Lolita:

- Continued developing her practice
- Taught throughout the United States
- Eventually settled in Florida
- Created her own teacher training program
- Became a guardian of classical knowledge

## Teaching Style

Lolita's approach reflects her training directly with Joseph:

- **Classical integrity** - Teaching exactly as Joseph taught her
- **Dance influence** - Graceful, artistic movement
- **Personal attention** - Working individually with each body
- **Historical context** - Sharing stories and knowledge from the original studio

## Preservation Work

As a direct link to Joseph Pilates, Lolita has been instrumental in:

- Preserving authentic teaching methods
- Sharing first-hand stories of Joseph and Clara
- Clarifying historical details about the original method
- Certifying new generations of classical teachers

## Philosophy

> "Joseph Pilates changed my life. I've spent my life sharing that gift with others."

Her teaching emphasizes:

- **Authenticity** - The method as Joseph taught it
- **Gratitude** - Honoring the gift of Pilates
- **Precision** - Exact execution of exercises
- **Legacy** - Passing knowledge forward

## Historical Significance

Lolita's importance to Pilates history cannot be overstated:

- **Living link** to Joseph Pilates
- **Primary source** for historical information
- **Keeper** of original teaching methods
- **Certifier** of future generations

## Continuing Work

Even after decades of teaching, Lolita continues to:

- Train and certify instructors
- Share stories of Joseph and Clara
- Attend Pilates conferences
- Preserve classical knowledge

## Legacy

Lolita San Miguel represents the most direct possible connection to Joseph Pilates' original teaching. Through her:

- The authentic method is preserved
- Historical accuracy is maintained
- Future teachers receive direct lineage
- Joseph's vision lives on

As the last person certified by Joseph Pilates, Lolita carries a responsibility that she has honored throughout her life. Her contribution to Pilates preservation is immeasurable.
