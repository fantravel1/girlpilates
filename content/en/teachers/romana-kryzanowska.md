## The Keeper of the Flame

Romana Kryzanowska (1923-2013) is widely regarded as the most important figure in preserving Joseph Pilates' original method. She trained directly under Joseph and Clara Pilates for over two decades and dedicated her life to maintaining the integrity of his work.

## Her Story

Born in 1923, Romana was a young ballet dancer when she injured her ankle. Her ballet teacher recommended she see Joseph Pilates for rehabilitation. This chance encounter in 1941 changed the course of Pilates history.

Romana quickly became devoted to the method and to Joseph himself. She trained under his direct supervision at his 8th Avenue studio in New York City until his death in 1967. After Joseph passed, Romana worked alongside Clara Pilates to continue the studio's operations.

## Preserving the Legacy

When Clara Pilates died in 1977, Romana became the primary torchbearer of classical Pilates. She continued teaching at the original studio location and eventually established Romana's Pilates to train new generations of teachers.

Her approach was unwavering: teach the method exactly as Joseph taught it. She famously said, "Don't change it. Don't add to it. Don't take away from it."

## Teaching Philosophy

Romana believed that Pilates was a complete system that didn't need modification. Key aspects of her approach included:

- **Strict adherence to the original exercises** as taught by Joseph
- **Proper sequencing** - exercises in the order Joseph intended
- **The classical repertoire** - all original exercises on all apparatus
- **Discipline and precision** - no shortcuts, no compromises

## Her Impact

Romana trained thousands of instructors who now teach worldwide. Her lineage includes many of today's most respected classical teachers. Through Romana's Pilates certification program, her methodology continues to spread globally.

## Notable Contributions

- Maintained the original Pilates studio after Joseph's death
- Created the first formal Pilates teacher training program
- Trained instructors from around the world
- Kept the classical method alive during decades when Pilates wasn't mainstream
- Documented Joseph's original exercises and their proper execution

## Famous Quote

> "Joseph Pilates was a genius. I was lucky enough to work with a genius. And I will teach what he taught me until my last breath."

## Legacy

Romana passed away in 2013 at age 90, having taught Pilates for over 70 years. Her contribution to preserving the authentic Pilates method cannot be overstated. Every practitioner today, whether they practice classical or contemporary Pilates, benefits from her dedication to keeping Joseph's vision alive.

Her students and their students continue to teach her methodology, ensuring that the original Pilates method remains accessible to future generations.
