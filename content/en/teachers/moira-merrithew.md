## Modernizing Pilates for Today's Body

Moira Merrithew, along with her husband Lindsay, co-founded STOTT PILATES in 1988. The company has become one of the most influential Pilates education organizations in the world, training over 60,000 instructors globally.

## The STOTT PILATES Difference

While respecting Joseph Pilates' original work, STOTT PILATES incorporates modern principles of biomechanics and sports science. Key modifications include:

### Five Basic Principles
1. **Breathing** - Emphasizing lateral breathing
2. **Pelvic Placement** - Neutral spine concept
3. **Rib Cage Placement** - Maintaining proper alignment
4. **Scapular Movement and Stabilization** - Shoulder blade awareness
5. **Head and Cervical Placement** - Proper neck alignment

### Neutral Spine Approach
Unlike classical Pilates' flattened spine position, STOTT PILATES emphasizes maintaining the spine's natural curves during many exercises.

## Building a Global Brand

Under Moira's leadership, STOTT PILATES has grown to include:

- Comprehensive instructor training programs
- Full line of equipment (Reformers, Cadillacs, Chairs)
- Specialty training (Athletic Conditioning, Rehabilitation, Pre/Postnatal)

## Educational Innovation

Moira has been instrumental in developing educational standards for the Pilates industry:

- **Detailed training manuals** covering anatomy and exercise science
- **Video learning resources** for instructors
- **Specialty tracks** for different populations
- **Research-backed** approach to exercise programming

## Recognition and Influence
