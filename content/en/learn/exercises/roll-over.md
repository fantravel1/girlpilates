## Why It Matters

The Roll Over flips the Roll Up concept: instead of your torso rolling up, your legs roll over. It's a controlled inversion that stretches the entire back body while building spinal articulation in reverse.

This exercise prepares you for more advanced inversions and develops the control needed to work safely with your spine overhead.

## What It Does

**Primary benefits:**
- Stretches the entire posterior chain (back, hamstrings)
- Develops spinal articulation in flexion
- Builds control in inverted positions
- Strengthens abdominals eccentrically
- Improves spinal mobility

**Muscles worked:**
- Rectus abdominis
- Deep abdominals
- Spinal extensors (eccentrically)
- Hip flexors
- Hamstrings (stretched)

## Step-by-Step Execution

### Starting Position

1. Lie on your back, arms by your sides, palms down
2. Legs extended toward ceiling (perpendicular to floor)
3. Legs together, feet softly pointed
4. Spine in neutral
5. Press arms into mat for stability

### The Roll Over

1. **Engage core**: Draw belly in, press arms down

2. **Lift hips**: Peel your spine off the mat, rolling hips over shoulders

3. **Legs overhead**: Continue until legs are parallel to floor overhead (don't strain - go only as far as comfortable)

4. **Flex feet and open**: Flex feet, open legs hip-width apart (in classical version)

5. **Roll down**: Articulate down one vertebra at a time, legs staying overhead as long as possible

6. **Lower legs**: Once spine is flat, legs return to starting position at 90 degrees

7. **Close legs and repeat**: Legs together, point feet, repeat 3-5 times

### Reverse Version

The classical sequence also includes reversing the pattern:
- Open legs at the start
- Roll over with legs apart
- Close legs overhead
- Roll down with legs together

## What to Feel

**You should feel:**
- Each vertebra articulating off and onto the mat
- Stretch through the back and hamstrings
- Controlled lowering (no flopping)
- Arms pressing down for stability

**You should NOT feel:**
- Weight on neck (weight should be on upper back/shoulders)
- Lower back strain
- Momentum carrying you
- Uncontrolled descent

## Common Mistakes

### The Neck Crusher

**Problem**: Rolling too far onto the neck, putting weight on cervical spine.

**Fix**: Only roll to upper back/shoulder level. Never put weight on the neck. If you need to go further, you're not ready.

### The Momentum Flipper

**Problem**: Using a swing/momentum to get legs overhead.

**Fix**: Slow down. The movement should be controlled from core, not thrown. Can't go over slowly? Reduce range.

### The Plop Down

**Problem**: Controlled on the way over, collapses on the way down.

**Fix**: The roll down is where the work is. Slower on the descent. Each vertebra touches mat one at a time.

### The Knee Bender

**Problem**: Knees bend as legs go overhead (usually tight hamstrings).

**Fix**: Keep legs as straight as possible. If hamstrings are limiting, don't roll as far overhead.

## Modifications

### Making It Easier

**Smaller range**: Only roll until hips lift slightly, then roll back down. Don't force legs to parallel.

**Bent knees**: Performing with knees bent reduces hamstring demand.

**Wall support**: Legs extend up a wall, rolling pelvis only slightly off floor.

**Skip the leg variations**: Keep legs together throughout (skip open/close).

### Making It Harder

**Slow tempo**: 4 counts over, 4 counts down.

**Arms overhead**: Removes the stability assist from arms.

**Add Jackknife**: From Roll Over, lift legs to ceiling while on shoulders.

## Contraindications

**Avoid or modify if you have:**
- Neck issues or injuries
- Cervical disc problems
- Uncontrolled high blood pressure
- Glaucoma or eye pressure issues
- Acute back pain

When in doubt, consult a professional before attempting inversions.

## Progressions

**Level 1**: Pelvis lifts 2-3 inches, legs stay vertical
**Level 2**: Roll to mid-back, legs at 45 degrees overhead
**Level 3**: Full roll over, legs parallel to floor
**Level 4**: Add leg variations (open/close)
**Level 5**: Slow tempo with full control both directions

## Teaching Cues

- "Press your arms down like you're pushing through mud"
- "Peel your spine off the mat like tape"
- "Weight on shoulders, NOT on neck"
- "Control the roll down - twice as slow as the way over"
- "Legs reach for the wall behind you"
- "Close the front of your body as you go over"

## The Safety Issue

Inversions require respect. The Roll Over puts your spine in a vulnerable position. Build up gradually:

1. Master the Roll Up first
2. Start with small range Roll Overs
3. Progress slowly over weeks/months
4. Never force range
5. Always be able to control the descent

## Key Takeaways

- Roll onto shoulders only, never neck
- Control the descent - that's where the work is
- Articulate each vertebra on the way down
- Modify if hamstrings or back limit range
- Progress gradually - this is intermediate for a reason
- Arms pressing down provides crucial stability
