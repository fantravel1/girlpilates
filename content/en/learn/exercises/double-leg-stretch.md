## Why It Matters

The Double Leg Stretch takes the stability challenge of the Single Leg Stretch and expands it: both arms AND both legs reach away from center simultaneously. This creates maximum challenge for the core to maintain the curled position.

It's a test of your ability to expand and gather without losing your center.

## What It Does

**Primary benefits:**
- Builds core stability under maximum lever arm
- Develops coordination of full body movement
- Challenges upper abdominal endurance
- Strengthens hip flexors and shoulder muscles
- Teaches the "expand and gather" pattern

**Muscles worked:**
- Rectus abdominis (maintaining curl)
- Transverse abdominis (stabilizing)
- Hip flexors (controlling legs)
- Shoulder muscles (reaching arms)
- Neck flexors (holding head position)

## Step-by-Step Execution

### Starting Position

1. Lie on your back, curl head and shoulders off the mat
2. Both knees pulled to chest
3. Hands on shins or ankles
4. Elbows wide
5. Gaze at your belly

### The Movement

1. **Inhale and reach**: Simultaneously extend both legs forward (to 45 degrees or higher) while reaching arms overhead by ears

2. **Expand**: Brief moment of maximum extension - body forms a long line, arms by ears, legs reaching away

3. **Exhale and gather**: Circle arms around to sides while drawing knees back to chest

4. **Gather**: Return to starting position, hands on shins

5. **Repeat**: 8-10 repetitions

### Arm Path Options

**Classical**: Arms reach up overhead, then circle wide to sides and back to shins

**Modified**: Arms reach forward (same height as legs) rather than overhead, then gather

The overhead reach is harder because it pulls you toward extension.

## What to Feel

**You should feel:**
- Core working intensely to maintain curl during the reach
- A stretch through the body at maximum extension
- Controlled gathering back to center
- Challenge increases as arms go overhead

**You should NOT feel:**
- Lower back arching when legs extend
- Upper body dropping as arms go overhead
- Neck straining excessively
- Rushed, uncontrolled movement

## Common Mistakes

### The Dropper

**Problem**: Upper body curl drops when arms and legs reach away.

**Fix**: This is the test. If you drop, make the movement smaller. Legs higher, arms not as far. Build to the full range.

### The Lower Back Archer

**Problem**: Lower back arches off mat when legs extend.

**Fix**: Keep legs higher (60 or even 90 degrees). Only lower as far as back stays flat.

### The Breath Holder

**Problem**: Forgetting to breathe during the reach.

**Fix**: The breath pattern helps. Inhale to reach (expanding), exhale to gather (compressing). Make it audible.

### The Arm Flailer

**Problem**: Arms moving randomly instead of in controlled path.

**Fix**: Think of tracing a specific shape - reaching to ears, then circling like you're drawing a large oval.

## Modifications

### Making It Easier

**Arms forward, not overhead**: Reaching arms to same height as legs (45 degrees) is significantly easier.

**Higher legs**: Keep legs at 60-90 degrees.

**Head down**: If neck fatigues, lower head and focus on limb coordination.

**Smaller range**: Don't reach as far. Stay closer to the starting position.

### Making It Harder

**Lower legs**: The lower the legs (maintaining flat back), the harder.

**Slower tempo**: 4 counts to reach, 4 counts to gather.

**Pause at extension**: Hold the extended position for 2-3 seconds.

**Add weights**: Light weights in hands (advanced only).

## The Core Stability Test

Here's the test for proper leg height:
- Place a hand under your lower back
- Perform the exercise
- If your back presses harder into your hand when legs reach, legs are too low

Adjust leg height until your back stays neutral throughout.

## Breathing Pattern

**Inhale**: Arms reach, legs extend (expanding the body)
**Exhale**: Arms circle, knees draw in (gathering the body)

The breath matches the action - inhale to expand, exhale to compress. This rhythm helps with control.

## Progressions

**Level 1**: Head down, arms forward, legs 90 degrees
**Level 2**: Head up, arms forward, legs 60 degrees
**Level 3**: Head up, arms overhead, legs 60 degrees
**Level 4**: Full expression - arms overhead, legs 45 degrees
**Level 5**: As part of complete Series of Five with added pause

## Teaching Cues

- "Reach and gather - like a starfish opening and closing"
- "Scoop deeper as you reach longer"
- "Your belly button is the anchor point"
- "Circle the arms like you're drawing a big oval"
- "Only reach as far as you can control"
- "Exhale like you're fogging a mirror as you gather"

## Place in the Series

Double Leg Stretch is second in the Series of Five:

1. Single Leg Stretch - single leg alternating
2. **Double Leg Stretch** - you are here
3. Single Straight Leg Stretch - scissors with straight legs
4. Double Straight Leg Stretch - both legs lower and lift
5. Crisscross - rotation added

Each exercise builds on the previous. Master #2 before adding #3.

## Key Takeaways

- Maintain the curl throughout - if you drop, make it smaller
- Legs only lower as far as back stays flat
- Arms overhead is the full challenge; arms forward is the modification
- Breathe: inhale to expand, exhale to gather
- The "gather" is as important as the "reach"
- Part of a progressive series - context matters
