## Why It Matters

The Twist (sometimes called "Twist" or "Side Bend with Twist") combines two challenging elements: the side plank position and spinal rotation. It demands shoulder stability, oblique strength, and rotational mobility simultaneously.

This exercise appears near the end of the classical mat order and requires strength and control built throughout the practice.

## What It Does

**Primary benefits:**
- Builds oblique strength in functional pattern
- Develops shoulder stability under load
- Improves thoracic rotation
- Challenges balance and proprioception
- Strengthens the entire lateral chain

**Muscles worked:**
- Obliques (both sides)
- Shoulder stabilizers
- Latissimus dorsi
- Quadratus lumborum
- Hip abductors
- Deep core stabilizers

## Step-by-Step Execution

### Starting Position

1. Sit on your right hip, legs stacked or staggered
2. Right hand on mat, directly under shoulder
3. Left arm by your side
4. Feet stacked or top foot in front for stability

### The Side Bend Prep

1. Press into right hand, lifting hips off mat
2. Extend left arm overhead, creating a long line from feet to fingertips
3. Hold the side plank position - this is Side Bend

### Adding The Twist

1. From the lifted position, rotate torso toward the mat
2. Thread the left arm under your body
3. Look toward your reaching hand
4. Unwind back to the side plank
5. Lower to starting position

6. **Repeat**: 3-5 times, then switch sides

### The Full Expression

In the classical version:
1. Lift into side plank
2. Reach arm overhead
3. Rotate and thread arm under
4. Unwind to side plank
5. Option to dip hip and lift again
6. Return to start

## What to Feel

**You should feel:**
- Obliques working to maintain the side plank
- Shoulder stabilizing under body weight
- Controlled rotation through the thoracic spine
- The whole lateral chain engaged

**You should NOT feel:**
- Shoulder pain or instability
- Lower back strain
- Wrist pain
- Collapsing through the movement

## Common Mistakes

### The Shoulder Sagger

**Problem**: Shoulder joint collapses, body sinks toward floor.

**Fix**: Actively push the floor away. Engage the serratus and lats. If shoulder can't stabilize, you're not ready for this exercise.

### The Hip Dropper

**Problem**: Hips sag toward floor during the side plank.

**Fix**: Lift from the obliques. Think of creating a rainbow arc with your body, not a hammock sag.

### The Neck Turner

**Problem**: Rotating only from the neck rather than the thoracic spine.

**Fix**: The rotation should come from your mid-back. Let your head follow the spine naturally, not lead it.

### The Speed Demon

**Problem**: Moving quickly without control.

**Fix**: Slow down. Each phase of the movement should be controlled. Speed comes after mastery.

## Modifications

### Side Bend Only (No Twist)

- Just practice the lift and hold
- Master stability before adding rotation
- This alone is a worthy exercise

### Knee Down

- Keep the bottom knee on the mat
- Reduces load on shoulder and core
- Good progression step

### Smaller Rotation

- Don't thread arm all the way under
- Just begin the rotation
- Build range over time

### Top Leg Forward

- Stagger feet with top foot in front
- Provides more stable base
- Common modification for beginners

## Prerequisites

Before attempting The Twist:

1. **Side Plank hold**: Can you hold for 30 seconds?
2. **Shoulder stability**: No pain in plank positions?
3. **Thoracic rotation**: Basic rotation without load?
4. **Core strength**: Built through the mat sequence?

## Progressions

**Level 1**: Side plank from knees, no twist
**Level 2**: Full side plank (Side Bend), no twist
**Level 3**: Side Bend with small rotation
**Level 4**: Full Twist with controlled threading
**Level 5**: Add hip dip and lift between twists

## Teaching Cues

- "Push the floor away - don't sink into your shoulder"
- "Lift your hip to the ceiling like a puppet string is pulling it"
- "Rotate from your ribs, not your neck"
- "Thread your arm like you're reaching for something behind you"
- "Keep both sides of your waist long - no crunching"
- "Control the entire movement - no flopping"

## The Rotation Pattern

Good rotation in The Twist:
- Comes from thoracic spine (mid-back)
- Head follows spine naturally
- Pelvis stays relatively stable
- Both shoulders stay active

Poor rotation:
- Neck only
- Lower back twisting
- Collapsing through the shoulder
- Lost plank position

## Building Shoulder Stability

The Twist requires significant shoulder stability. Build this through:
- Plank holds (front and side)
- Push-up variations
- Arm circles with control
- Down dog holds

If your shoulder isn't ready, the exercise will tell you. Listen.

## Key Takeaways

- Combines side plank with rotation - both are advanced elements
- Master Side Bend before adding the Twist
- Shoulder stability is non-negotiable
- Rotation comes from thoracic spine, not neck
- Modify by dropping the knee or reducing rotation
- Control throughout - this isn't about momentum
