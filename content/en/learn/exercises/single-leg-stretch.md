## Why It Matters

The Single Leg Stretch is the first in the classical "Series of Five" - a sequence of abdominal exercises performed in succession. It establishes the upper body curl position that you'll maintain through increasingly difficult challenges.

This exercise teaches you to stabilize your torso while your legs move - a fundamental skill for all Pilates work and for life.

## What It Does

**Primary benefits:**
- Builds core stability during leg movement
- Develops upper abdominal endurance
- Teaches coordination (opposite arm to leg)
- Prepares for more challenging ab work
- Strengthens hip flexors

**Muscles worked:**
- Rectus abdominis (maintaining the curl)
- Transverse abdominis (stabilizing)
- Hip flexors (moving legs)
- Neck flexors (holding head position)
- Shoulders (arm placement)

## Step-by-Step Execution

### Starting Position

1. Lie on your back, curl head and shoulders off the mat
2. Pull one knee to chest, the other leg extended at 45 degrees (or higher if needed)
3. Outside hand on the ankle of the bent knee
4. Inside hand on the knee of the bent leg
5. Elbows lifted wide
6. Gaze at your belly

### The Movement

1. **Switch legs**: Simultaneously straighten the bent leg and pull the other knee to chest

2. **Switch hands**: Outside hand to ankle, inside hand to knee of the new bent leg

3. **Maintain curl**: Upper body stays lifted throughout - no bouncing

4. **Breathe**: Inhale for one switch, exhale for one switch (or inhale for two, exhale for two)

5. **Repeat**: 10-20 repetitions (5-10 each leg)

### Hand Placement (Why It Matters)

- **Inside hand on knee**: Prevents the knee from falling inward, maintains hip alignment
- **Outside hand on ankle**: Provides stability and gentle pull
- **Elbows wide**: Opens the chest, prevents collapsing

This specific hand placement isn't random - it protects your alignment.

## What to Feel

**You should feel:**
- Upper abs working to hold the curl
- Deep abs stabilizing as legs switch
- Controlled, even leg movement
- Chest open despite the curl

**You should NOT feel:**
- Lower back arching off the mat
- Neck strain (excessive)
- Bouncing or jerky movements
- One leg moving faster than the other

## Common Mistakes

### The Lower Back Archer

**Problem**: Lower back lifts off mat when extended leg lowers.

**Fix**: Keep the extended leg higher (60 or even 90 degrees). Only lower it as far as your back stays down.

### The Head Bobber

**Problem**: Head bobs up and down with each leg switch.

**Fix**: The upper body position is fixed - imagine your chest is glued in place while only your legs move.

### The Rushed Switcher

**Problem**: Moving legs fast without control.

**Fix**: Slow down. Each switch should be deliberate. The exercise is about control, not speed.

### The Sloppy Hands

**Problem**: Hands wherever, elbows collapsed.

**Fix**: Be precise with hand placement. It matters for your hip alignment.

## Modifications

### Making It Easier

**Higher extended leg**: 90 degrees is easier than 45 degrees.

**Head down**: If neck fatigues, lower head and continue with legs.

**Tabletop only**: Keep both legs in tabletop, just touch one toe down and return.

**Slower pace**: Take your time with each switch.

### Making It Harder

**Lower extended leg**: The lower the leg, the more core challenge (keep back down).

**Faster pace**: Once form is solid, increase speed.

**Add the rest of the series**: Perform Single Leg Stretch, Double Leg Stretch, Single Straight Leg, Double Straight Leg, and Crisscross in sequence.

## The Low Back Test

Here's how to know if your extended leg is at the right height:

1. Place your hand under your lower back
2. Begin the exercise
3. Your back should NOT press down onto your hand harder when the leg extends

If it does, your leg is too low for your current strength. Raise it.

## Integration: The Series of Five

Single Leg Stretch is traditionally performed as part of a sequence:

1. **Single Leg Stretch** - You are here
2. **Double Leg Stretch** - Both legs extend together
3. **Single Straight Leg Stretch** - Scissors with straight legs
4. **Double Straight Leg Stretch** - Both legs lower together
5. **Crisscross** - Rotation added

Master each before adding the next. The full series without rest is a significant challenge.

## Progressions

**Level 1**: Head down, higher leg, slow pace
**Level 2**: Head up, higher leg, moderate pace
**Level 3**: Head up, 45-degree leg, rhythmic pace
**Level 4**: Full expression with proper hand placement
**Level 5**: As part of complete Series of Five

## Teaching Cues

- "Scoop your belly in and up"
- "Pull the knee TO you, not you to the knee"
- "Outside hand to ankle, inside hand to knee"
- "Elbows wide like you're holding a beach ball"
- "Only lower the leg as far as your back stays down"
- "Smooth switches, no jerking"

## Common Questions

### Where should I look?

At your belly. This helps maintain the curl and reminds you to keep abs engaged. Don't look at your moving legs.

### How fast should I go?

Controlled rhythm - not rushed, not glacially slow. Each switch should be deliberate. Speed comes after control.

### My neck gets tired. What should I do?

Lower your head for a few reps, then continue. Over time, neck endurance builds. Also check: are your shoulders creeping up?

## Key Takeaways

- Hand placement matters: outside hand to ankle, inside hand to knee
- Upper body stays still - only legs move
- Extended leg height depends on your ability to keep low back down
- This is the foundation for the entire abdominal series
- Control matters more than speed
