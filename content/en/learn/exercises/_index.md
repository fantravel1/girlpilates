## The Original 34

Joseph Pilates developed a specific sequence of mat exercises, traditionally performed in order. While modern practice has evolved, understanding these foundational movements remains essential.

This section provides detailed breakdowns of classic exercises - not just how to do them, but why they work, what to feel, common errors, and how to progress.

## By Level

### Beginner Foundations
Start here. These exercises teach the fundamental principles that everything else builds upon.

- [The Hundred](/learn/exercises/the-hundred/)
- [The Roll Up](/learn/exercises/roll-up/)
- [Single Leg Circles](/learn/exercises/single-leg-circles/)
- [Rolling Like a Ball](/learn/exercises/rolling-like-a-ball/)
- [Single Leg Stretch](/learn/exercises/single-leg-stretch/)

### Intermediate Challenges
Once you've mastered the basics, these exercises add complexity and demand.

- [The Roll Over](/learn/exercises/roll-over/)
- [Double Leg Stretch](/learn/exercises/double-leg-stretch/)
- [Spine Stretch Forward](/learn/exercises/spine-stretch/)
- [Open Leg Rocker](/learn/exercises/open-leg-rocker/)
- [The Saw](/learn/exercises/the-saw/)

### Advanced Work
These require significant strength, control, and body awareness developed through consistent practice.

- [The Teaser](/learn/exercises/teaser/)
- [The Swan Dive](/learn/exercises/swan-dive/)
- [Swimming](/learn/exercises/swimming/)
- [Control Balance](/learn/exercises/control-balance/)
- [The Twist](/learn/exercises/the-twist/)

## How to Use This Section

Each exercise breakdown includes:

- **What it does** - The purpose and benefits
- **Step-by-step execution** - Detailed instructions
- **What to feel** - Internal cues and sensations
- **Common mistakes** - What goes wrong and why
- **Modifications** - Making it accessible
- **Progressions** - Making it harder

## A Note on Progression

Pilates exercises aren't about conquering levels. A well-executed Hundred is more valuable than a sloppy Teaser. Master each exercise before moving on. The advanced work will come when your body is ready.
