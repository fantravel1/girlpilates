## Why It Matters

Single Leg Circles teach a fundamental principle: the limbs move independently while the core stays stable. Your leg makes circles; your pelvis stays still. This disassociation is essential for efficient movement in all of life.

The exercise also develops hip mobility - something many people lose from sitting and limited movement variety.

## What It Does

**Primary benefits:**
- Develops hip mobility in all directions
- Teaches core stability while extremities move
- Strengthens hip muscles through range of motion
- Challenges pelvic stability
- Warms up the hip joint

**Muscles worked:**
- Hip flexors (lifting)
- Hip extensors (lowering)
- Adductors and abductors (circles)
- Deep core stabilizers
- Quadriceps of the working leg

## Step-by-Step Execution

### Starting Position

1. Lie on your back, one leg extended on the mat
2. Other leg extended toward ceiling (as straight as hamstrings allow)
3. Arms long by your sides, palms down, pressing into mat
4. Pelvis in neutral - both hip bones level
5. Shoulders relaxed, neck long

### The Movement

1. **Cross**: The lifted leg crosses the body toward the opposite shoulder

2. **Circle down**: The leg sweeps down toward the mat

3. **Circle out**: The leg circles out to the side (same side hip)

4. **Return up**: The leg sweeps up to the starting position

5. **Repeat**: 5 circles in one direction, then reverse for 5 circles

6. **Switch legs**: Repeat the sequence on the other side

### Direction Matters

- **Classical direction**: Cross body first, circle down, out, and up (like drawing a circle starting at 12 o'clock, going to 10, 6, 2, and back to 12)
- **Reverse**: Out first, then down, across, and up

Do both directions on each leg.

## What to Feel

**You should feel:**
- Hip joint moving freely through range
- Deep abdominals working to stabilize pelvis
- Stretch in the circling leg (hamstring, hip flexors, inner thigh)
- The bottom leg anchoring

**You should NOT feel:**
- Pelvis rocking with each circle
- Lower back arching off the mat
- Tension in neck and shoulders
- Hip clicking or pinching

## Common Mistakes

### The Rocking Pelvis

**Problem**: The pelvis tips and rocks with each circle - especially when the leg crosses midline or goes to the side.

**Fix**: Make smaller circles. Press arms into mat for stability. Only circle as far as you can while keeping pelvis absolutely still.

### The Monster Circles

**Problem**: Huge circles that sacrifice control for range.

**Fix**: Start with small circles (like the size of a grapefruit). Earn bigger circles through proven stability.

### The Bent Knee Creep

**Problem**: The circling leg bends more and more to compensate for tight hamstrings.

**Fix**: Keep a consistent knee position. If hamstrings are tight, start with the leg at an angle rather than vertical.

### The Ignored Bottom Leg

**Problem**: Focusing only on the circling leg; bottom leg flops or bends.

**Fix**: Keep the bottom leg active - straight, engaged, pressing into the mat.

## Modifications

### Making It Easier

**Bend the bottom leg**: Foot flat on floor gives more stability. Master this before extending the bottom leg.

**Smaller circles**: The smaller the circle, the easier it is to maintain stability.

**Bend the circling leg**: A soft knee reduces hamstring demand.

**Arms in T position**: Wider arm position provides more stability.

### Making It Harder

**Larger circles**: Increase range while maintaining stability.

**Arms overhead**: Removes the arm stability assist.

**Flex the foot**: Adds hamstring challenge.

**Slow down**: Slow, controlled circles are much harder than fast ones.

## Circle Size Guidelines

**Beginner**: Circle the size of a softball
**Intermediate**: Circle the size of a basketball
**Advanced**: Circle the size of a beach ball - entire range of motion

Always prioritize pelvic stability over circle size.

## The Disassociation Principle

This exercise teaches you that:
- The hip joint is separate from the pelvis
- The leg can move without the spine moving
- Stability and mobility coexist

This skill transfers to walking, running, kicking, and virtually all lower body movement.

## Progressions

**Level 1**: Bottom knee bent, small circles
**Level 2**: Bottom knee bent, medium circles
**Level 3**: Both legs straight, small circles
**Level 4**: Both legs straight, medium circles
**Level 5**: Arms overhead, large circles with perfect stability

## Teaching Cues

- "Draw a circle on the ceiling with your big toe"
- "Hip bones stay like headlights pointing straight up"
- "Anchor your opposite hip"
- "Press through your arms like you're pushing the floor away"
- "Only as big as you can control"
- "The still part is as important as the moving part"

## Common Questions

### My hip clicks during circles - is that bad?

Clicking without pain is usually harmless (often tendons moving over bone). If painful, reduce range or consult a professional.

### How straight does my leg need to be?

Straight enough to challenge your hamstrings, bent enough to maintain good form. A slight bend is fine.

### Should I point or flex my foot?

Traditionally pointed, but both work. Flexed is harder due to hamstring stretch.

## Key Takeaways

- Pelvic stability is the point - not how big your circles are
- Start smaller than you think you need to
- Both directions, both legs
- Bottom leg stays active
- The stillness of the core matters as much as the movement of the leg
