## Where Pilates Lives

A Pilates studio is more than a room with equipment. It's a philosophy made physical - a space where teaching traditions are transmitted, communities form, and bodies transform.

From Joseph Pilates' original 8th Avenue studio to today's innovative spaces, studios have been the heart of the Pilates world.

## What You'll Learn

### The Original Studios

The New York studios where Joseph Pilates and the first-generation teachers taught became legendary. Understanding these spaces helps explain why Pilates developed as it did - and why different lineages emerged.

### Studios Doing Things Differently

Today's innovative studios are questioning assumptions: Who should Pilates serve? What should a studio look like? How can spaces be more accessible, sustainable, and community-focused?
