## The Man Behind the Method

Joseph Hubertus Pilates was born in 1883 in Mönchengladbach, Germany. A sickly child suffering from asthma, rickets, and rheumatic fever, he was determined to overcome his physical limitations.

### Early Influences

Young Joseph studied anatomy books and observed animals in the woods near his home. He experimented with various exercise forms including yoga, gymnastics, boxing, and martial arts. By adolescence, he had developed such a remarkable physique that he posed for anatomical charts.

### The War Years

When World War I broke out, Joseph was living in England, where he worked as a circus performer and boxer. As a German national, he was interned as an "enemy alien" on the Isle of Man.

It was here that Pilates truly developed his method. He:

- Created exercise routines for fellow internees
- Rigged bed springs to hospital beds, creating the first Pilates apparatus (precursor to the Reformer)
- Rehabilitated injured and bedridden soldiers

Legend holds that when the influenza epidemic of 1918 struck, none of Pilates' followers fell ill - testament to their improved physical condition.

## Contrology Is Born

Joseph called his method "Contrology" - the science of controlled movement. He believed that the mind must control the muscles, and that physical fitness was the foundation of happiness.

### Coming to America

In 1926, Joseph emigrated to the United States. On the ship, he met Clara, a nurse who would become his wife and collaborator. Together, they opened their first studio at 939 Eighth Avenue in New York City.

### The Dance Connection

The studio was located in the same building as several dance studios. Dancers discovered that Pilates' method helped them:

- Recover from injuries
- Build strength without bulk
- Improve flexibility and control
- Extend their careers

Word spread through the dance world. Legends like George Balanchine and Martha Graham sent their dancers to "Uncle Joe."

## The Evolution of Pilates

### The Original Exercises

Joseph developed approximately 500 exercises, 34 of which comprise the "Classical Mat" sequence still taught today. He also created various apparatus:

- **Reformer** - The most well-known Pilates machine
- **Cadillac** (Trapeze Table) - A bed-like frame with hanging springs
- **Wunda Chair** - A compact, versatile piece of equipment
- **Barrel** - Various curved surfaces for stretching and strengthening
- **Magic Circle** - A ring for resistance exercises

### The Elders

When Joseph died in 1967, a small group of dedicated students - later known as "The Elders" - carried on his work. Each developed their own interpretation:

| Elder | Contribution |
|-------|-------------|
| Romana Kryzanowska | Classical Pilates, direct lineage |
| Ron Fletcher | Towelwork, breathing patterns |
| Carola Trier | First to open studio outside NYC |
| Eve Gentry | Therapeutic applications |
| Kathy Grant | NYU Tisch School program |
| Mary Bowen | Pilates Plus Psyche integration |

### Modern Pilates

In the 1990s, Pilates exploded into mainstream fitness. Key developments:

- **2000**: A federal court ruled "Pilates" is a generic term, not a trademark
- **Certification programs** multiplied, making training more accessible
- **Contemporary Pilates** evolved, integrating physical therapy and sports science
- **Clinical Pilates** emerged for rehabilitation
- **Props** like foam rollers and resistance bands were incorporated

## Joseph's Philosophy

Joseph believed in the unity of body, mind, and spirit. His principles included:

> "Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness."

> "In 10 sessions you'll feel the difference, in 20 sessions you'll see the difference, and in 30 sessions you'll have a whole new body."

> "A man is as young as his spinal column."

He advocated for:

- Regular practice over intense, sporadic workouts
- Proper breathing as the foundation of health
- Mindful movement over mechanical repetition
- Balance between strength and flexibility

## Pilates Today

From one small studio in New York, Pilates has grown into a global phenomenon:

- Practiced in over 100 countries
- Millions of practitioners worldwide
- Available in gyms, studios, physical therapy clinics, and homes
- Adapted for athletes, seniors, prenatal/postnatal, rehabilitation, and more

Joseph's vision of healthy, mindful movement has touched countless lives - including yours, as you practice the method he created nearly a century ago.
