## The Chosen Successor

If there is one name synonymous with "authentic" Pilates, it's Romana Kryzanowska. For over seven decades, she was the fiercest guardian of Joseph Pilates' original method, training thousands of teachers and insisting - sometimes controversially - that there was only one correct way to do the work.

Her influence is so profound that "Romana's Pilates" became its own certification program, and debates about what constitutes "real" Pilates often center on her interpretation of the work.

## A Dancer's Path to Pilates

Romana was born in 1923 and trained as a ballet dancer, eventually joining George Balanchine's School of American Ballet. Like many dancers of her era, she first encountered Joseph Pilates when she needed rehabilitation for an ankle injury in the early 1940s.

What started as physical therapy became a life's calling. Joseph Pilates saw something special in the young dancer - her precision, her dedication, her ability to understand movement from the inside. She became not just a student but an apprentice, learning to teach under Joseph and Clara's watchful eyes.

## Learning From the Source

Romana spent nearly two decades training directly with Joseph Pilates before his death in 1967. This extended apprenticeship gave her an unusually complete understanding of his method:

- **The full repertoire**: Mat, Reformer, Cadillac, Chair, Barrels, and more
- **The philosophy**: Joseph's ideas about breath, concentration, and the unity of mind and body
- **The teaching approach**: How to observe, correct, and inspire students
- **The personality**: His intensity, humor, and uncompromising standards

After Joseph's death, Clara Pilates asked Romana to take over the original 8th Avenue studio. This anointing as successor became central to Romana's identity and her claim to represent the authentic tradition.

## The Classical Keeper

### Preserving the Original Work

Romana became famous - and sometimes infamous - for her insistence on preserving Joseph Pilates' method exactly as he taught it. She resisted modifications, questioned innovations, and pushed back against those who wanted to "improve" or "update" the work.

Her philosophy was clear: Joseph Pilates was a genius who spent decades refining his method. Who were we to second-guess him?

This approach meant:
- Exercises performed in specific orders for specific reasons
- Precise spring settings and equipment specifications
- Traditional cueing language passed down verbatim
- Resistance to incorporating outside influences or research

### The Gratz Connection

Romana maintained close ties with Gratz Industries, which manufactured Pilates equipment according to Joseph's original specifications. For classical purists, "real" Pilates required "real" equipment - the Gratz Reformer, Cadillac, and Chairs that Romana used.

## Teaching Style

Those who studied with Romana describe a demanding, sometimes imperious presence. She expected excellence and wasn't afraid to say when she didn't see it.

### Memorable Traits

- **The accent**: Her distinctive voice, mixing Hungarian origins with decades in New York
- **The touch**: Hands-on corrections delivered with precision
- **The standards**: "Again!" was her frequent refrain until movements met her approval
- **The passion**: Even in her 80s, she demonstrated exercises with remarkable control

### Famous Phrases

Romana's teaching was peppered with memorable expressions:
- "Squeeze the juice out of your muscles!"
- "Lengthen your spine - grow taller!"
- "Connect everything to your powerhouse!"
- "Make your body a machine - but a beautiful machine!"

## Building a Global Network

Romana didn't just teach clients - she created teachers. Through her certification program, she trained instructors who spread classical Pilates worldwide:

### Romana's Pilates

In the 1990s, as Pilates became mainstream, Romana formalized her teacher training through "Romana's Pilates." This certification emphasized:

- **Comprehensive training**: 600+ hours covering all apparatus
- **Lineage connection**: Teachers learned who taught their teachers
- **Quality control**: Regular observation and continuing education
- **Brand protection**: After the "Pilates" trademark was lost, "Romana's Pilates" identified the classical approach

### Notable Students

Many influential teachers trace their training to Romana:
- Sari Mejia Santo (Romana's daughter, now leading Romana's Pilates)
- Bob Liekens
- Cynthia Lochard
- Jerome Weinberg
- Dorothee VandeWalle

## Controversies and Criticisms

Romana's uncompromising approach generated both devotion and criticism:

### The Authenticity Debate

Some questioned whether any one person could claim to represent the "true" Pilates tradition. Other Elders had also studied extensively with Joseph - why was Romana's interpretation the definitive one?

### Resistance to Evolution

Critics argued that refusing to incorporate new anatomical knowledge or movement science research limited the method's development. Physical therapy and biomechanics had advanced significantly since the 1920s.

### Accessibility Concerns

The classical approach could be demanding and sometimes unsuitable for certain bodies or conditions. Some felt Romana's standards prioritized form over individual adaptation.

## Later Years and Legacy

Romana continued teaching well into her 80s, an embodiment of her own method's effectiveness. She died in 2013 at age 90, having dedicated over 70 years to Pilates.

### What She Left Behind

- **A methodology**: The classical Pilates approach, codified and teachable
- **A training system**: Thousands of certified instructors worldwide
- **An organization**: Romana's Pilates continues under her daughter's leadership
- **A standard**: A benchmark against which other approaches are measured
- **A debate**: Ongoing conversations about tradition versus innovation

## Romana's Influence Today

Even teachers who don't follow the classical approach often define themselves in relation to it. "Contemporary Pilates" exists partly as a contrast to Romana's classical interpretation.

Her influence appears in:
- **Equipment design**: Many manufacturers still reference original Gratz specifications
- **Exercise sequencing**: The classical order remains widely taught
- **Teaching language**: Her cueing phrases echo in studios worldwide
- **Certification standards**: Long, comprehensive training programs
