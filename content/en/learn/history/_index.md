## A Method Born of Necessity

Pilates wasn't invented in a laboratory or designed by committee. It emerged from one man's lifelong quest to overcome his own physical limitations - and his observation of how bodies move, strengthen, and heal.

Understanding this history deepens your practice. You're not just doing exercises; you're participating in a tradition nearly a century old.
