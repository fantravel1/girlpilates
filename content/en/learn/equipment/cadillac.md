## What Is the Cadillac?

The Cadillac - also called the Trapeze Table - is a raised, bed-like platform with a metal frame overhead, equipped with various bars, springs, straps, and hanging attachments. It looks like a four-poster bed designed by an engineer.

Joseph Pilates originally created it for bedridden patients who couldn't get to the floor or other equipment. He attached springs and bars to hospital beds to allow movement and rehabilitation. The full apparatus evolved from there.

## Why "Cadillac"?

Legend says a student remarked that the apparatus was "like a Cadillac" - the ultimate luxury. The name stuck. It's also called the Trapeze Table because of the hanging bars and straps that resemble trapeze equipment.

## How It Works

### The Components

**The Table**: A padded, raised platform (about table height) where you lie, sit, or stand. Being elevated makes it easier for clients who struggle with floor work.

**The Frame**: Metal uprights and overhead bars that create a "cage" around the table, providing attachment points for various tools.

**The Push-Through Bar**: A horizontal bar that moves through the frame in an arc. Can be spring-loaded from above or below.

**The Roll-Down Bar**: Attached to overhead springs, used for spinal articulation exercises.

**The Leg Springs**: Long springs attached at the foot end for leg work.

**The Arm Springs**: Springs attached at various heights for arm and upper body work.

**The Trapeze (Fuzzy Hang)**: A hanging bar with loops for hands or feet, allowing suspended exercises.

**The Tower**: A half-Cadillac that attaches to a wall, providing many Cadillac exercises in less space.

## What Makes It Special

### Unmatched Versatility

The Cadillac offers:
- More attachment points than any other apparatus
- Springs pulling from multiple directions
- Exercises in every position imaginable
- Support for those who need it
- Challenge for those who don't

### Ideal for Rehabilitation

The raised table means:
- Clients don't have to get up and down from the floor
- Easier for limited mobility, injuries, post-surgery
- Instructor can access client easily
- Spring assistance helps with movements that are otherwise impossible

### Three-Dimensional Challenge

Unlike the Reformer (which moves mostly in one plane), the Cadillac allows:
- Springs from above (like the roll-down bar)
- Springs from below (like push-through variations)
- Springs from the sides
- Movement in rotation, flexion, extension, and lateral bending

## Common Cadillac Exercises

### Roll-Down Bar Work

Holding the overhead bar, rolling down through the spine against spring resistance, then rolling back up.

**What it develops:**
- Spinal articulation
- Controlled flexion
- Core strength with assistance

### Push-Through Bar

A bar that arcs through the frame, either pushing away or pulling toward you against spring resistance.

**What it develops:**
- Shoulder stability and mobility
- Chest opening
- Full-body integration

### Leg Springs Series

Lying on the table with springs attached to ankles, performing circles, scissors, walking, and other patterns.

**What it develops:**
- Hip strength and mobility
- Core stability
- Leg coordination

### Hanging/Trapeze Work

Using the fuzzy hangs for inversions, pull-ups, or suspended abdominal work.

**What it develops:**
- Upper body strength
- Spinal decompression
- Core challenge in suspension

### Tower Exercises

When using a Tower (wall unit), similar exercises with the push-through bar and leg springs.

## Who Benefits Most

### Rehabilitation Clients

- Post-surgical recovery
- Injury rehabilitation
- Chronic pain management
- Neurological conditions
- Those who can't get to the floor

### Beginners

- Spring assistance makes hard exercises possible
- Raised table is less intimidating
- Easy to modify everything
- Builds confidence before progressing

### Advanced Practitioners

- Exercises that aren't possible on other equipment
- Three-dimensional challenge
- Decompression and opening
- Variety to prevent plateau

### Older Adults

- Easier access (table height)
- Support for balance issues
- Joint-friendly spring work
- Seated and lying options

## Cadillac vs. Reformer

| Feature | Cadillac | Reformer |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Accessibility | Easier (raised) | Harder (floor level) |
| Versatility | More options | Many, but fewer |
| Rehabilitation | Excellent | Good |
| Standing work | Limited | Good |
| Space needed | More | Less |
| Cost | Higher | Lower |
| Availability | Rarer | Common |

Many studios have Reformers but fewer have Cadillacs. Having both is ideal.

## Finding Cadillac Work

### Full Cadillac

- Only available in well-equipped studios
- Usually private sessions only
- More expensive due to equipment cost and space
- Worth seeking out for rehabilitation or variety

### Tower (Wall Unit)

- More common in studios
- Fits in smaller spaces
- Offers many Cadillac exercises
- Sometimes used in group classes

### Ask Your Studio

Many studios have Towers even if not prominently featured. Ask if Cadillac or Tower work is available.

## What to Expect

Cadillac sessions are typically:
- Private or semi-private
- Highly customized
- Excellent for addressing specific issues
- More expensive than Reformer group classes
- Deeply therapeutic when done well

## Key Takeaways

- The Cadillac is Pilates' most versatile apparatus
- Originally designed for rehabilitation and still excels there
- Offers spring resistance from multiple directions
- Ideal for those who struggle with floor work
- Less common than Reformers but worth seeking
- Tower units provide many Cadillac benefits in less space
- Excellent for beginners, rehabilitation, and advanced work
