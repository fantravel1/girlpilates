## Beyond the Mat

While mat Pilates is accessible anywhere, Joseph Pilates designed an entire system of apparatus to support and challenge the body in ways the mat alone cannot. Each piece serves specific purposes and offers unique benefits.

## The Major Apparatus

- [The Reformer](/learn/equipment/reformer/) - The most popular piece of Pilates equipment
- [The Cadillac (Trapeze Table)](/learn/equipment/cadillac/) - The most versatile apparatus
- [The Wunda Chair](/learn/equipment/chair/) - Compact but powerful
- [The Barrels](/learn/equipment/barrels/) - Curved surfaces for spinal work
- [Props and Small Equipment](/learn/equipment/props/) - Magic Circles, bands, and more

## Equipment vs. Mat

Neither is "better" - they serve different purposes:

**Mat Pilates:** Accessible anywhere, body weight resistance, develops self-sufficiency

**Equipment Pilates:** Spring resistance assists AND challenges, supports rehabilitation, offers more variety

Most serious practitioners do both.
