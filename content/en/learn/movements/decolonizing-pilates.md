## The Uncomfortable Truth

Look at Pilates marketing. Browse studio Instagram feeds. Walk into most Pilates spaces.

You'll see a pattern: predominantly white, thin, affluent, able-bodied women. The occasional exception proves the rule.

This isn't accident. It's the result of history, economics, and assumptions that have gone unexamined for too long. And it's limiting who benefits from a method that could help many more people.

The conversation about race, access, and inclusion in Pilates is happening now. Here's what you should know.

## A Brief History of Access

### Joseph Pilates' New York

When Joseph Pilates opened his studio in 1926, New York was segregated. His clientele came primarily from the dance world - itself predominantly white.

This wasn't necessarily Joseph's intention. By accounts, he was willing to work with anyone. But the context limited who walked through his door.

### The Elder Years

The first-generation teachers who preserved the method were mostly white. Kathy Grant, as a Black woman certified by Joseph himself, was exceptional - and her path was harder because of it.

### The Boutique Era

As Pilates went mainstream in the 1990s and 2000s, it positioned itself as premium fitness. Studios opened in affluent neighborhoods. Prices rose. The aesthetic became increasingly narrow.

This wasn't conspiracy - it was market forces. But market forces aren't neutral. They reflect and reinforce existing inequalities.

## The Current Landscape

### By the Numbers

The Pilates industry lacks comprehensive demographic data, but available research suggests:

- The vast majority of Pilates practitioners are white women
- The instructor population is even less diverse than clients
- Studios concentrate in wealthy, often predominantly white neighborhoods
- Typical class prices ($25-50+) exclude many potential practitioners

### Barriers to Access

**Economic barriers:**
- High per-class costs
- Expensive equipment
- Costly teacher training ($3,000-$10,000+)
- Studios in expensive neighborhoods

**Cultural barriers:**
- Marketing that centers white, thin bodies
- Studios that don't feel welcoming to diverse bodies
- Instructor demographics that don't reflect communities
- Cueing and imagery rooted in white cultural assumptions

**Physical barriers:**
- Studios without accessible entrances
- Equipment designed for narrow body ranges
- Instructors untrained in adaptive approaches

## What "Decolonizing" Means

The term "decolonizing" refers to examining how colonial history shapes current practices and power structures. In Pilates context, this includes:

### Questioning Assumptions

- Who is the "default" body in Pilates instruction?
- Whose movement traditions are valued?
- Who gets to be an expert?
- Who profits from the industry?

### Examining Origins

- How did Joseph Pilates draw on movement traditions from around the world?
- What were the racial dynamics of his time and place?
- How have those dynamics shaped the method's development?

### Changing Power Structures

- Who owns studios and training programs?
- Who makes decisions about industry standards?
- Whose voices are amplified, whose silenced?

## Voices Leading Change

### Sonja Herbert and Black Girl Pilates

Sonja Herbert founded Black Girl Pilates to create visibility and community for Black practitioners and teachers. What started as a hashtag has become a movement advocating for:

- Representation in marketing and leadership
- Accessible pricing
- Welcoming studio cultures
- Mentorship for Black instructors

### Dianne Bondy

Yoga teacher Dianne Bondy's work on body diversity and inclusion has influenced Pilates as well. Her emphasis on adapting practices for all bodies challenges narrow definitions of "correct" form.

### Jessamyn Stanley

Though primarily a yoga voice, Jessamyn Stanley's work on body liberation and challenging fitness industry assumptions resonates across movement practices, including Pilates.

### Community Studios

Studios across the country are experimenting with:
- Sliding scale pricing
- Community classes in non-traditional spaces
- Teacher training scholarships for underrepresented groups
- Explicitly anti-racist policies and training

## Practical Steps for Change

### For Studios and Teachers

**Examine Your Marketing**
- Who appears in your images?
- Do your words welcome all bodies?
- Would someone outside your current demographic feel invited?

**Address Pricing Barriers**
- Sliding scale options
- Community classes
- Partnerships with community organizations
- Work-study opportunities

**Diversify Your Instructor Pool**
- Scholarships for underrepresented trainees
- Mentorship programs
- Hiring practices that address bias
- Pay equity

**Create Welcoming Spaces**
- Train staff in inclusive practices
- Examine studio location and accessibility
- Gather feedback from diverse clients
- Address microaggressions promptly

**Continue Your Education**
- Anti-racism training
- Cultural humility work
- Learning from diverse voices
- Examining your own assumptions

### For Practitioners

**Vote with Your Dollars**
- Support inclusive studios
- Ask about equity practices before joining
- Advocate for change in studios you attend

**Amplify Diverse Voices**
- Follow and share teachers of color
- Recommend inclusive instructors
- Challenge narrow representations

**Examine Your Own Practice**
- Notice who's in classes with you
- Reflect on your assumptions about bodies
- Support accessibility initiatives

## Common Pushback (And Responses)

### "This is just virtue signaling"

Representation and access aren't symbolic - they have material effects on who can practice and who can earn a living teaching.

### "Joseph Pilates would be upset about this focus"

We can't know what Joseph Pilates would think. We do know he valued health for all and was willing to innovate. Expanding access seems consistent with his principles.

### "Why make everything about race?"

Race already shapes everything about the Pilates industry - who practices, who teaches, who profits. Noticing this isn't "making it about race" - it's acknowledging existing reality.

### "Isn't the market just responding to demand?"

Markets don't exist in a vacuum. They're shaped by history, policy, and choices. The current market reflects past decisions that can be made differently.

### "I don't see color"

Research consistently shows that "colorblindness" actually perpetuates bias by refusing to acknowledge real differences in experience and access.

## The Goal Isn't Guilt

This conversation isn't about making white practitioners or teachers feel bad. Guilt is unproductive.

The goal is:

- **Awareness**: Seeing patterns previously invisible to us
- **Action**: Making concrete changes in our practices
- **Humility**: Recognizing what we don't know
- **Solidarity**: Working together toward a more accessible practice

Pilates should be available to anyone who might benefit. Currently, it isn't. That's not individual fault - it's systemic pattern. And systems can be changed.

## A More Inclusive Future

Imagine Pilates studios in every neighborhood. Instructors who reflect their communities. Pricing that doesn't exclude working people. Marketing that celebrates body diversity. Training that addresses adaptive needs.

This isn't utopia - it's what's possible when we decide the current situation isn't acceptable.

The method Joseph Pilates created has helped countless people. Many more could benefit if barriers came down. That's not a criticism of the method - it's a recognition of its potential.

- "Decolonizing" means examining how power and access are distributed
