## Pilates Meets You Where You Are

While Pilates principles are universal, application varies by who you are and what you do. An office worker needs different emphasis than a marathon runner. A 25-year-old athlete has different considerations than a 65-year-old retiree.

This section offers guidance for specific populations - not different exercises necessarily, but different focus, modifications, and priorities.

## Finding Your Fit

The best Pilates practice addresses YOUR specific needs:

- What your daily life demands of your body
- What imbalances your activities create
- What goals matter to you
- What limitations you're working with

Use these guides as starting points, then work with an instructor who can personalize further.
