## Evidence Meets Experience

Pilates practitioners know the method works - they feel it in their bodies. But what does the scientific research actually show? Is there evidence beyond personal experience?

This section explores Pilates research honestly: what's been studied, what we've learned, and where questions remain.

## What You'll Learn

### Research Findings

Decades of studies have examined Pilates for various conditions and populations. Some findings are robust; others are preliminary. Knowing the difference helps you make informed decisions.

### How to Read Claims

The fitness world is full of exaggerated claims. Understanding how research works helps you evaluate what you hear - in studios, online, and in marketing.

### Where Science Meets Practice

Research findings don't always translate directly to the studio. Bridging this gap requires nuance.
