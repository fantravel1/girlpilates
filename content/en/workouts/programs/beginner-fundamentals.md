## Overview

New to Pilates? This is your starting point. You'll learn the essential principles and basic exercises that form the foundation of all Pilates practice.

## Before You Begin

- Wear comfortable, fitted clothing
- Use a padded mat or carpeted floor
- Work in a quiet space where you can focus
- Have a pillow nearby for head support if needed

## The Workout

### Learning to Breathe (3 minutes)

**Finding Lateral Breathing**
1. Lie on your back, knees bent, feet flat
2. Place hands on your lower ribs
3. Inhale through nose - feel ribs expand sideways
4. Exhale through mouth - feel ribs draw together
5. Practice 10 breaths

**Breath with Core Connection**
1. Same position
2. As you exhale, gently draw navel toward spine
3. Keep breathing while maintaining this gentle engagement
4. Practice 5 breath cycles

### Finding Neutral Spine (2 minutes)

**Neutral Spine Awareness**
1. Lie on back, knees bent
2. Flatten lower back to floor - this is "imprint"
3. Arch lower back - this is "extension"
4. Find the middle - natural curve, this is "neutral"
5. Practice moving between these 5 times
6. Rest in neutral

### Basic Exercises (8 minutes)

**Pelvic Tilts (1.5 min)**
- Exhale, tilt pelvis and flatten back
- Inhale, return to neutral
- 10 slow reps
- *Purpose: Mobilize lower back, feel core*

**Chest Lift (1.5 min)**
- Hands behind head, elbows wide
- Exhale, curl head and shoulders up
- Keep lower back on mat
- Inhale, lower with control
- 8 reps
- *Purpose: Basic ab strengthening*

**Toe Taps (2 min)**
- Bring legs to tabletop (90-degree angles)
- Keep spine neutral
- Lower one toe to floor
- Return to start
- Alternate legs
- 10 each leg
- *Purpose: Core stability with leg movement*

**Bridge (1.5 min)**
- Feet flat, arms by sides
- Exhale, press through feet
- Lift hips until body forms straight line
- Inhale at top
- Exhale, lower slowly
- 6 reps
- *Purpose: Back and glute strength*

**Arm Floats (1.5 min)**
- Arms at ceiling, palms facing each other
- Keep ribs anchored
- Lower arms overhead toward floor
- Only go as far as ribs stay down
- Return to start
- 8 reps
- *Purpose: Core stability with arm movement*

### Cool-Down (2 minutes)

**Knee Drops**
- Knees bent, feet wide
- Let both knees fall to one side
- Return to center
- Fall to other side
- 4 each side

**Knees to Chest**
- Hug both knees
- Rock gently side to side
- 30 seconds

**Deep Breath**
- Release legs
- Take 3 full breaths
- Notice how your body feels

## Key Principles to Remember

1. **Quality over quantity** - 5 good reps beat 15 sloppy ones
2. **Breath** - Never hold your breath
3. **Core** - Gentle engagement, not gripping
4. **Control** - Slow is better than fast
5. **Alignment** - Pay attention to your body position

## What's Next?

Practice this routine 3-4 times before moving on. When it feels comfortable, try the "20-Minute Core Blast" or "30-Minute Full Body Flow" with modifications.
