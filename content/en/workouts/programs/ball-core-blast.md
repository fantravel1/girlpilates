### What You'll Need

- Exercise mat
- Water bottle

### Warm-Up (3 minutes)

1. **Seated Bounces** - Sit on ball and gently bounce (1 min)
2. **Seated Hip Circles** - Circle hips in both directions (1 min)
3. **Spinal Waves** - Roll through spine while seated (1 min)

3. **Ball Cat-Cow** - Gentle spinal movement (30 sec)

### Tips for Success

- Move slowly and with control
- If balance is challenging, widen your base of support
- Breathe! Exhale on exertion
