## The Concept

Who says you need to get dressed to work out? Do this workout in your comfiest pajamas, before coffee, right when you wake up. Movement in your natural, cozy state.

### In Bed Wake-Up (3 minutes)

**Full Body Stretch**
- Reach arms overhead, point toes
- Stretch like a cat
- Hold 10 seconds
- 3 times

**Knee Hugs**
- Hug knees to chest
- Rock side to side
- Wake up your spine
- 1 minute

**Supine Twist**
- Knees fall to one side
- 30 seconds each side
- Gentle wakeup for spine

### On the Floor (in PJs!) (10 minutes)

**Pelvic Tilts (1 min)**
- Knees bent, feet flat
- Gently tilt pelvis
- 15 slow reps

**Bridges (2 min)**
- Lift hips up
- 15 reps
- Your PJs are your workout clothes

**Ab Series (3 min)**
- 15 chest lifts
- 20 single leg stretches
- 15 crisscross

**Cat-Cow (2 min)**
- Wake up spine
- 15 slow cycles
- Yawn if you need to

**Side Leg Series (2 min)**
- Lie on side
- 15 leg lifts each side
- PJs don't restrict movement!

### Final Stretches (2 minutes)

**Child's Pose**

- 1 minute
- Enjoy your last cozy moment

**Seated Forward Fold**
- Let head hang
- 30 seconds
- Now you're ready for the day

**Seated Twist**

- Wrung out and awake

## Why PJ Pilates Works

- Removes barrier of "getting ready" to exercise
- Catches you before excuses set in
- Warm from bed = flexible muscles
- Cozy clothes don't restrict movement
- You're done before you're fully awake!

## Make It a Habit

1. Put your mat by your bed
2. Set alarm 15 minutes early
3. Don't think, just roll onto mat
4. Do the workout still half asleep
5. Then shower and start your day

## The No-Excuses Morning

- No need for workout clothes
- No gym bag to pack
- No traffic to fight
- Already done before breakfast
- Start every day accomplished

## Best PJ Recommendations

For Pilates, wear:
- Soft cotton or bamboo
- Not too baggy (gets in the way)
- Nothing with buttons to dig in
- Your comfiest favorites
- Whatever feels like home
